Start -->1737561216085206[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

Hey, hey, heyâ€”
What are you doing!
That's so rude!
How dare you sit on Croaks without permission?
Are you trying to squish him?
It's lucky he got out of your way!]
1737561216085206 -->1737561216085209{ }
1737561216085209 -->|I thought you were a bench...|1737561216085210[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

You make a fair point...
But Croaks still strongly condemns you!
Croaks just wants to be left here alone, 
to reminisce about his lost love, UNDISTURBED!]
1737561216085209 -->|Aren't benches made for sitting on?|1737561216085210[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

1737561216085210 -->1737561216086237{ }
1737561216086237 -->|Well, I'll get going then...|1737561216086238[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

Croaks really wanted to share his story with you...
What a pity, come back and find him when you want to listen.]
1737561216086237 -->|Tell me your story.|1737561216086240[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

That day, Croaks was admiring the scenery by the sea,
as he is now. When a beautiful girl passed by,
fell in love with him at first sight, and sat on him.]

1737561216086240 -->1737561216087265[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Didn't she just mistake you for a bench...]
1737561216087265 -->1737561216087266[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

Not at all!
It was true love! True love!
Later, Croaks found out that 
this beautiful girl was actually a noble princess...
It's just a pity that Croaks is not a prince,
and our brief romance had to come to an end.
She wanted to take Croaks along, but he gets seasick and is afraid of water.
Looking back, Croaks can't help but regret his decision!
If only Croaks had been braver.]
1737561216087266 -->1737561216087269{ }
1737561216087269 -->|How vulgar...|1737561216088294[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

Speaking of which,
when the princess said goodbye,
she tossed a package to Croaks from her ship.
Sadly, the ship was too far away,
and the package fell into the water...
Croaks is so curious to find out what's inside!
Maybe it's a parting gift? Or a letter from the princess?
It's so frustrating! Croaks is mortally afraid of water. 
Standing on the edge of the dock is already too much...]
1737561216087269 -->|How tragic...|1737561216088294[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Mr.Croaks:</b>

Although a frog being afraid of water is a little suspicious,
I guess helping him won't hurt.
I'll try transforming into slime and investigating the nearby waters.]
