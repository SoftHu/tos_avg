I'm glad to hear you've mastered Slime Power.
Now you can irrigate the fields more efficiently.
Like us foxes,
those tanuki can also transform into other yokai.
I suggest that you and Kon keep an eye on
the yokai around you...
Tanuki are known for having elusive motives.
There's no simple answer as to why they're here.
It is paramount that we find out what
they are after in order to safeguard Seikyu.]

Yes, Fox Spirits,
we'll investigate as best as we can
to protect Seikyu from harm.]
1761910989212934 -->1761911109766407[<b>Speaker ðŸ‘‰ &lbrace;sw.foxgod&rbrace;:</b>

Your safety is our top concern,
more than anything else.]
