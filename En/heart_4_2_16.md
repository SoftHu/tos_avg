\nBack in my hometown, I used to take the kids to play by the water. 
First, I taught them to swim, then how to fish. 
Watching the kids grow up... being a parent is truly gratifying.\nI haven't seen them for over three years now. 
My wife wrote to me recently, saying the kids miss me a lot 
â€“ and I miss them tooâ€¦]
1754469756059213 -->|Why not bring them here?|1754471684313685[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>
\nSighâ€¦ I have my reasons. 
Everything I'm doing now is to provide a better life for my family's future.\nI never mentioned it before, but I'm from Shikoku. 
That place was originally our pelican clan's territory; 
we've thrived there for generations.\nTen years ago, 
the tanuki clan expanded their influence there and took over Shikoku's territory. 
We weaker yokai became vassals of the tanuki.\nThough they called us vassals, it was nothing but slavery. 
Barely making ends meet was a struggle, 
so I had to come to Seikyu to make a living.]

1754471684313685 -->|You've had it rough, sir.|1754472914768477[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>
\nDriving out the tanuki clan from Shikoku is almost impossible now. 
All I can hope for now is an early retirement and to reunite with my family.]

1754472914768477 -->|That sounds dodgyâ€¦|1754473541054051[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>
\nAhemâ€¦ Don't worry about the details, I'm not doing anything bad! 
I just want to retire as soon as possible!\nWe got so caught up in talking that we didn't catch any fish. 
Let's call it a draw this time and we can compete again another time.\nThanks for listening to me ramble on for so long. 
As fellow outsiders, feel free to ask for my help any time you like.]
