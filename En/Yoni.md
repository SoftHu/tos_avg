Okay... goodbye.]
Start -->1727668439958689[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thanks for your patronage...]

Ah... Hello.]
Start -->1727668439958693[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's you! How can I assist you?]
Start -->1727668551084199[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Do you like singing? Sing to the empty fields,
to the galaxy and the moon, to the waterfalls...
Burst into song!
I love to sing a little tune whenever I'm alone.
I feel like I could be a singer!
But I get shy when there's an audience.
It's so frustrating. How do I overcome my shyness?]
Start -->1727668551084201[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Well... don't know if you noticed...
Mr. Hephaestus is very gentle!
Even though he's tall and fierce looking...
Turns out, he's quite shy in private!
Every day he would come to vocal practice with me.
He just sits there quietly, but he's always there.
Makes me blush, you know...
Should I get him a gift for his company?]

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4105&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753123645732252[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, you made it!
I knew you wouldn't miss out on all this fun!
Ready to party Carp Festival style?]

Ah... what a romantic summer night.
Makes me want to sing...
Sorry, that was a weird thing to say, haha.]
Start -->1758258686936627[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Goodbye...
Have a pleasant evening.]

Start -->1763131072195029[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Is this ...... some new kind of prank?
Or did ...... uh ...... I do something to piss you off?
Please do tell me if I've done something wrong.]
Start -->1763131072196055[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;! You actually made a special birthday gift for me.
It's the best gift I've ever received!
Let me remember this wonderful moment ......]
Start -->1763131072196057[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

I was actually wondering just now if &lbrace;playername&rbrace; would have a birthday present for me too.
So excited to say ......]
Start -->1763131072197083[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Wish I could spend this day with &lbrace;playername&rbrace; every year ......]
Start -->1763131072197085[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Is this for my birthday ......
This ...... Thanks for the thought.]
Start -->1763131072197087[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Receiving this ...... on my birthday was a little bit of a slight embarrassment to say the least.
It's not &lbrace;playername&rbrace;'s fault though.]
Start -->1763131072198113[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>
