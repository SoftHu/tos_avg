Hello...
You're [playername], right?
If you want something,
feel free to look around....]

1741368656357643 -->|Miss Oda sent me to see you.|1741368831225105[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Sasaki:</b>

Yes, she called ahead of you.
I've been giving it some thought.
Back in our hometown, every family keeps small animals.
Seikyu has vast expanses of lands,
but everyone seems to enjoy life huddled by the sea.
If you're interested, I'm willing to help you build a barn.
It's the first step in livestock farming,
but you'll need to collect the necessary materials.]

Don't worry,
I'll ask friends from my hometown to send some animals over.
Once you've got enough money together, you can buy them from me.
Rest assured,
I give friends of Miss Oda the biggest discount.]
1741369597831442 -->|That's great!|1741369916772633[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Sasaki:</b>

I've listed the materials you'll need.
You'll have to find them, though,
and you'll need a furnace to process the ores.]
