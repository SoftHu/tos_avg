Thank you so much!
Just when I was at a loss,
you suddenly appeared.
When I came to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; hoping to become a singer,
honestly, at first, I thought if I failed, I'd just go home.
I always thought that if a designer as famous as &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace;
agreed to help me, maybe my chances of becoming a singer
would be better.
&quot;But I've had a lot of time to think while I've been waiting for you here.
I'm not going to give up and let your help go to waste.
I'll work hard to become a singer and bring joy with my music!&quot;]

But I've had a lot of time to think while I've been waiting for you here.
I'm not going to give up and let your help go to waste.
I'll work hard to become a singer and spread joy with my music!]
1767747552461828 -->|Everyone loves your voice.|1767747552471053[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

Thank you,
you're the first person to believe in me like this.]
1767747552464902 -->1767747552466951[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yoni:</b>

I hope you're not my first and last audience in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;.
Thank you,
