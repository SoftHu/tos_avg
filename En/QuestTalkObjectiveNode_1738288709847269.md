Thank you so much!
Just when I was at a loss,
you suddenly appeared.
I came to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; hoping to become a true singer,
but honestly, at first, I thought
if I failed, I'd just go home. Maybe it's not for me...
I always thought that if someone as famous as &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace;
would agree to help me,
maybe my chances of becoming a singer would be better.
But I've had a lot of time to think while I've been waiting for you here.
I'm not going to give up and let your help go to waste.
I'll work hard to be a singer and bring joy with my music!]

you're the first person to believe in me like this.]
