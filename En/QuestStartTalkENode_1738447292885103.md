it's too big for you... or that you're 
too short to look over the desk...

Because you're gonna be confident!

I've marked the location on your map &#40;press M to view map&#41;.

Just follow the path and try to get there before it's dark! 
Be careful... i-it can get scary at nightâ€¦

If you get hungry, feel free to check out the Fish Shop
to the left of the dock.

Th-that's my uncle's shop!
Tell him that I said Hi! ... and that you're new here..
He'll probably give you some useful pointers!

N-now go a-and have fun, you guys!]
