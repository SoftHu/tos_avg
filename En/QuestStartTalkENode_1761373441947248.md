I'm a Samoan. My family used to be quite well-off.
But unfortunately, my old man was a lousy gambler and lost the family business ......
The three of us brothers had to come to Seikyu to make a living.
I had a childhood sweetheart named Yoshiko. We were very much in love.
Unfortunately, my aunt and uncle don't think my family can make Yoshiko happy.
They want to marry Yoshiko off to a rich boy from the same village. ......]
