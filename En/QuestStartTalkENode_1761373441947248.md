Greetings, you must be &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
My name is Theo and I hope I'm not intruding.

1761374578907764 -->|Let's hear what you need first|1761437403457146[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

I'm from Satsuma. My family used to be quite well-off.
But unfortunately, my old man was a lousy gambler and lost the 
family business... My brothers and I had to come to Seikyu to make a living.
I have a childhood sweetheart named Ryoko.
Sadly, her parents don't think I can make Ryoko happy.
They want her to marry a rich boy from our village...]

Ah no no no no no...
I didn't mean that. It never crossed my mind.
I heard you and Ms. Shuten are close friends.
I just want to ask you to check with her
if she needs somebody to work at the restaurant.
I just want to make some money so I can
go back home and marry Ryoko.
I can't stand by and watch my sweetheart marry someone else.]
