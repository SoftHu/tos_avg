\nStanding behind someone without saying a word... 
Sneaking around, it's very rude.]
1752689880679815 -->|Sorry...|1752690924668679[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>
\nIf you stood silently behind other Crow Tengus like that, 
they would happily remove your head from your shoulders.\nUnfortunately, this is Seikyu and there are no assassins here, 
so your head can stay where it is.]
1752689880679815 -->|I was captivated by the conversation...|1752690924668679[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

\nI am Nyotengu, the keeper of order in Seikyu. 
I reviewed your background before you arrived here.\nSeikyu isn't as densely populated as Kyushu or Shikoku, 
we have strict standards for accepting immigrants. That's part of my job too.\nEnough of that, it's quite boring. Little fox, do you drink? Join me for a few.]

\nThe first principle of flying is to overcome your inner fear. 
Take a deep breath and open your eyes!]
1753128694524304 -->|I'm a bit afraid of heights...|1753209835135381[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>
\nRemember this feeling... You should thank your yokai lineage. 
Not everyone gets the chance to experience soaring through the sky.]

\nWe are encountering strong air currents, keep steady and stay calm. 
It's normal to be buffeted in the airflow. 
The key is not to resist the changes around you.\nTake a deep breath, be one with the wind... 
Become it, then harness it and let it help you fly higher and further.\nYou have good intuition! You're starting to get familiar with the feeling of flying.]

\nYou'll learn more flying techniques on your own over time. 
Now, I need to tell you the second principle of flying: know your limits.\nNew fliers often get so caught up in the thrill of soaring that they overlook their 
physical exhaustion and end up crashing. It's very dangerous.\nSo here's some life-and-death advice: never overdo it! 
Okay, it's time to stop and recover some energy.]
