\nAh, there you are. 
How was your first night in the new house?]

\nHappy to hear it. 
Now let's put this land to good use.]
1768881203408877 -->|I had trouble sleeping. |1768881355970548[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nMaybe I can help. 
Labor always tires me out.]

\nSince the farm has been inactive awhile, there's high demand for fresh crops.\nI've heard rumors about you transformation talents.
We could make good money if you got the farm producing again. 
Have you considered boar-powered farming?\nWild boars are strong, 
and they're naturals at turning up soil. \nHow about you give it a try for me? 
I'll even throw in some seeds and a watering can to get you started.]
1768881410613237 -->|I can give it a go.|1768881530854395[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

\nYou're a true merchant already. 
After your harvest, put some crops into the that box. 
I'll give you a good price, promise!]
