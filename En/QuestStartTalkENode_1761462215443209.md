Yikes, what a rare sight. I thought the foxes were extinct.
Didn't realize there were survivors.]
1761701241683240 -->1761701284527401{ }
1761701284527401 -->|You look just like Theo.|1761704555641134[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You know my brother?
Then you probably know we're twins.
I'm the youngest. Just call me Ivan.]
1761701284527401 -->|You look just like Taji.|1761704555641134[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

1761704555641134 -->1761704620713263{ }
1761704620713263 -->|What are you doing here?|1761704649089332[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

What else is there to do here?
Of course I'm here to gamble.
Back in the day, our family was one of the wealthiest in Satsuma.
Until our good-for-nothing father gambled away the family fortune.
What Pops lost, I'm gonna win it all back at the casino!]
1761704620713263 -->|Are you here to see Theo?|1761704661288245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

How did that happen...]
1761704649089332 -->1761704805271862{ }
1761704805271862 -->|Don't literally gamble your life away.|1761705096379707[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Hahaha, I can tell what you're thinking by the look on your face. 
You must be thinking, what a pity,
this guy has such a hardworking brother,
and all he can do is come up with get rich quick schemes like his old man.
But unlike my father, I don't do anything I'm not sure of.
As a fox, I'm sure you've heard of a secret book
called The Gambler King.]
1761704805271862 -->|Now that's some ambition!|1761710933418319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

But unlike my father, I don't do anything I'm not sure of.

1761705096379707 -->1761705557383484{ }
1761705557383484 -->|Uh...|1761705710196033[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

What the... how's that even possible? The foxes of Seikyu love gambling 
and are so good at cheating. If I could've learned a few tricks from them, 
turning my family's fortune around would've been easy.
I came to Seikyu to do exactly that, even though the foxes were long gone,
all is not lost if I can get my hands on that book.
Will you help me? Whatever I make, you'll get a handsome cut.]
1761705557383484 -->|Never heard of it.|1761705710196033[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

1761706718893378 -->|Where can I find this secret book?|1761707005660485[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I've heard of an underground ruin in Seikyu, 
where the foxes' treasures are stashed.
The book must be there. I'm placing my trust in you!]
