Ouch, that's rare. I thought the foxes were extinct.
I didn't realize there were survivors.]
1761701241683240 -->1761701284527401{ }
1761701284527401 -->|You look just like Tiff.|1761704555641134[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You know my brother?
Then you probably know we're twins.
I'm the oldest. Just call me Iwasuke.]

1761704620713263 -->|What are you doing here?|1761704649089332[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

What else is there to do here? Well, of course, it's to have a big bet.
Back in the day, our family was one of the best in Satsuma.
Unfortunately, our old man was really no good and lost the family fortune.
What Pops lost, I'm going to take back at the casino through and through!]
1761704620713263 -->|Are you here to see Tiff?|1761704661288245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

How come? ......]
1761704649089332 -->1761704805271862{ }
1761704805271862 -->|Don't get your hopes up on gambling!|1761705096379707[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Hahaha, I can tell by the look on your face what you're thinking
You must be thinking that this guy's big brother is so hardworking and down-to-earth.
How come this guy is just like his old man, just thinking about getting something for nothing.
But unlike my old man, I don't do anything I'm not sure of.
Since you're a fox, I'm sure you've heard of a secret gambling book
Called The King of Thousands.]
1761704805271862 -->|What a hot episode!|1761710933418319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

1761705557383484 -->|Uh ......|1761705710196033[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Aaah, how come you don't know this ......
The Fox Fairies of Seikyu are especially fond of gambling. They're all very good at cheating.
If you can learn gambling from the fox fairies, it's easy to revitalize your family's business by gambling.
I came to Seikyu with exactly this idea in mind, even though the fox fairies were gone
But as long as I can find The King of a Thousand Kings as well.
Can you help me? You'll get your share of what I earn.]
1761705557383484 -->|Never heard of it.|1761705710196033[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

1761706718893378 -->|Where to find this secret book?|1761707005660485[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I heard that Seikyu had an underground relic that hid various treasures of the Fox Fairies.
I'm sure the secret book is hidden there too. Then I'm counting on you!]
