Fishing is my escape.
When I was little, I had a very strict family,
but I found freedom by that deep pond.
Even though they're no longer by my side,
I still enjoy the tranquility of fishing.]

1752150842246603 -->|Musashi's childhood home?
|1752150972573138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Ahem, I don't think we need to talk about that.
I'm just happy to find a new fishing buddy.
I used to go fishing with Uncle Torleone.
He cared more about the size and weight of the catch,
so fishing with him always felt weirdly competitive...]
1752150842246603 -->|Sounds like there's a story there.|1752150972573138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

1752151238919635 -->|I don't really care about the outcomeâ€¦|1752151483876826[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Seems we're on the same page when it comes to fishing.]
1752151238919635 -->|Actually, I do care about the catch.|1752151514554843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Looks like you're as competitive as Uncle Torleone!
Haha, you'll get along well with him.
But sometimes you gotta relax and live in the moment.]

This is the moment. I think we caught one!
When the paint arrives, I'll show you how to make
gyotaku, the ancient art of printing fish on paper.
It dates back to the Song dynasty of China.
You can frame a gyotaku print and hang it on the wall.
It's a great collectible.]
1752151796367724 -->1752152897572205{ }
1752152897572205 -->|Sure!|1752152938692978[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh, I didn't realize how late it is.
Let's call it a day. Time to go back and feed Daifuku.
Well then, see you again soon.]
1752152897572205 -->|I'm looking forward to it.|1752152938692978[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh, I didn't realize how late it is.

This is my first time visiting Mr. Musashi's house.
Scratch scratch scratch.]
1752153011933557 -->1752153046167926[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

If Kon's up for it, you're welcome any time.
You've been griping about &lbrace;playername&rbrace; ditching you
and leaving you alone. Feeling lonely at home, huh?]
1752153046167926 -->1752153319985527{ }
1752153319985527 -->|Is that how Kon feels?|1752153555967358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Spend more time with me and all is forgiven!]
1752153319985527 -->|I might have overlooked Kon's feelings.|1752153555967358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Spend more time with me and all is forgiven!]
1752153555967358 -->1752153607355775[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Look at you two. You're the perfect siblings.
Hey, I heard you've been poking around in those ruins.
Dangerous stuff.
I had a friend get some emergency meds for you.]
1752153607355775 -->1752153731191168{ }
1752153731191168 -->|Thank you.|1752153832661383[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

We're friends, aren't we?
Don't worry about it!]
1752153731191168 -->|That's so thoughtful.|1752153832661383[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

We're friends, aren't we?
Don't worry about it!]
1752153832661383 -->1752153888458120[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Found anything interesting in the ruins?
Tell us about it!]
1752153888458120 -->1752153915281801{ }
1752153915281801 -->|I had a fight with a tanuki!|1752153949910412[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Wha...? &#40;Shocked&#41;]
1752153949910412 -->1752153997110669[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Tanuki in Seikyu?!
That's truly unheard of.
Why would they come to Seikyu?
Could it be...
&#40;Impossible. I handled everything flawlessly...&#41;]
1752153997110669 -->1752154116159886{ }
1752154116159886 -->|You're acting suspicious!|1752154285366675[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

You... you misunderstood me!]
1752154116159886 -->|What about the tanuki?|1752154327645588[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Since the decline of kitsune, tanuki have been
waging wars over territory.
Those vicious creatures wreaked havoc everywhere.
I thought Seikyu was a sanctuary,
but it turns out tanuki are lurking here too...
I need to inform the townspeople about this.
Seikyu isn't safe anymore, be careful on your way back.]

Musashi is usually so graceful and composed,
but he got flustered when we mentioned tanuki...
Haha, he must be really scared of them!
But not me!
If they pick on you, I'll scratch them till they
scurry away fearing for their lives!]
