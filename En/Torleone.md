What can I do for you, kid?]
Start -->1727314770217057[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

None]
Start -->1727314770218083[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

If you can't swim, you'd better stay far away from the sea.
That's my advice to you.]
Start -->1727314770218085[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Feel free to look around. It's all fresh catches, just brought in.]
Start -->1727314770218087[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

People are good to me, and I have a duty to protect them.]
Start -->1727314770218089[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

None]
Start -->1727315484267627[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Goodbye, kiddo.]
Start -->1727315624140909[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727315624141935[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727315624141937[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727315624141939[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727315624142965[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727315624142967[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727315624142969[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1727315788092541[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Isn't Seabert adorable?
I've never taken care of a kid before, but my sister insisted on giving Seabert to me to fix my bad temper.
Now I am a kind elder, hahaha. I have to admit, my sister makes a good point.]
Start -->1727315788093569[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Do you like fishing? Many people underestimate it, but to me, fishing is no different from real combat!
Engaging in a battle of wits and courage with your opponent across the water... It's thrilling! Let's go fishing together sometime!]
Start -->1757108606568673[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

If you can't swim, you'd better stay far away from the sea.
That's my advice to you.
Although our elders always taught us to face our fears, the dangers of the sea are not as simple as you think. Many of my good brothers are buried in this sea.]
Start -->1757108860803302[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Cutting ties with your past self is very difficult... After all, people are not cold machines, and past events cannot truly be forgotten.
Sometimes, old brothers from the Raging Waves gang still come to find me, even though I've clearly said I quit. But brothers from the past are still brothers.]
Start -->1757109332396266[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Since coming to Aoba, I've had a lot more free time. When I was running the gang, I was always worried about many things.
Sleeping peacefully for an entire afternoon like this was unthinkable in the past.]
Start -->1757109419328749[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I'm used to the nightlife filled with bright lights and loud music, and I can't completely let it go...
Fortunately, Aoba also has bars and casinos that rival those in big cities, so let's enjoy a drink or two.]
Start -->1757109614104816[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

It's a rare good weather, young people should go out more. You should take a break too, don't be too hard on yourself...]
Start -->1757109684529395[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Wandering around on a rainy day, be careful not to catch a cold... Would you like to come in for a cup of hot tea and wait for the rain to stop?]
Start -->1758006961589840[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Good evening, what a coincidence to meet you here. Actually, I don't come here often. As I get older, I avoid crowded places.
Seeing young people so full of energy, I can't help but lament the passage of time.]
Start -->1758007060539986[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

The young lads from the Raging Waves gang always challenge me to a drinking contest. Next time, we should just have a themed party here.]
Start -->1758007681235540[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Don't drink in silence with an old man like me. Go have fun with them...]
Start -->1758165713182325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

The first half of my life was a huge gamble. I'm tired of feeling like I'm putting myself in a gamble...]
Start -->1758166261541495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Gambling is exciting, isn't it? The unknown outcome quickens your heartbeat, gets your blood pumping. It reminds me of the days of fighting for territory.]
Start -->1758257374056054[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I used to celebrate summer festivals at sea. The deck would be decorated brightly, and it was so lively... The summer festivals on land have their own unique flavor!]
Start -->1758257458516600[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Young people should enjoy the festival atmosphere... Go on, have fun.]
