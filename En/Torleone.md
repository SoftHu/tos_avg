What can I do for you, kid?]
Start -->1727314770217057[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Here for the fish? Or you got some problem that needs fixin'?
I'm only teasing. You're looking at a retiree now.
My problem fixin' days are long behind me.]
Start -->1727314770218083[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

If you can't swim, you'd better stay far away from the sea.
That's my advice to you.]
Start -->1727314770218085[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Feel free to look around. All caught fresh today!]
Start -->1727314770218087[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

People are good to me, and I have a duty to protect them.]
Start -->1727314770218089[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

You can call me uncle if you like.
I am longer in the tooth than you, after all.
In the past, the older fellas in the gang would look for
promising youngsters, show them the ropes, test them.
You get their help, you climb the ladder faster than anyone else.]
Start -->1727315484267627[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Goodbye, kiddo.]
Start -->1727315624140909[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727315624141935[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727315624141937[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727315624141939[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727315624142965[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727315624142967[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727315624142969[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1727315788092541[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Isn't Seabert adorable?
I've never taken care of a kid before, but my sister insisted on giving Seabert to me to fix my bad temper.
Now I am a kind elder, hahaha. I have to admit, my sister was right.]
Start -->1727315788093569[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Do you like fishing? Many people underestimate it, but to me, fishing is no different from combat!
Engaging in a battle of wits and courage with your opponent across the water... It's thrilling! Let's go fishing together sometime!]
Start -->1757108606568673[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

If you can't swim, you'd better stay far away from the sea.
That's my advice to you.
Although our elders always taught us to face our fears, the dangers of the sea are not to be taken lightly. Many of my good brothers are buried in this sea.]
Start -->1757108860803302[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Cutting ties with your past self is very difficult... After all, people are not emotionless machines, and past events cannot truly be forgotten.
Sometimes, old brothers from the Raging Waves gang still come to find me, even though I've made it clear I quit. But brothers from the past are still brothers.]
Start -->1757109332396266[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Since coming to Aoba, I've had a lot more free time. When I was running the gang, there was a always a lot on my mind.
Sleeping peacefully for an entire afternoon like this was unthinkable in the past.]
Start -->1757109419328749[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm used to nights filled with bright lights and loud music. 
Sometimes It can be hard to completely let go of the past...
Fortunately, Aoba also has bars and casinos that rival those in big cities, so let's enjoy a drink or two.]
Start -->1757109614104816[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Rare good weather we're having, young people should get outside more. You should take a break too, don't be too hard on yourself...]
Start -->1757109684529395[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Wandering around on a rainy day, be careful not to catch a cold... Would you like to come in for a cup of hot tea and wait out the rain?]
Start -->1758006961589840[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Good evening, what a coincidence meeting you here. Actually, I don't come here often.
As I get older, I avoid crowded places.
Seeing young people so full of energy, I can't help but lament the passage of time.]
Start -->1758007060539986[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The young lads from the Raging Waves gang always challenge me to a drinking contest. Next time, we should just have a themed party here.]
Start -->1758007681235540[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Don't drink in silence with an old man like me. Go have fun with them...]
Start -->1758165713182325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The first half of my life was a huge gamble full of risks.
I'm tired of that reckless way of life.]
Start -->1758166261541495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Gambling is exciting, isn't it? The unknown outcome quickens the heart, gets your blood pumping. It reminds me of the days of fighting for territory.]
Start -->1758257374056054[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I used to celebrate summer festivals at sea. The deck would be decorated brightly, and it was so lively... The summer festivals on land have their own unique flavor!]
Start -->1758257458516600[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Youngsters should enjoy the festival atmosphere... Go on, have fun.]
Start -->1763223315188454[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I didn't expect that I could still receive such a nice gift even though I left the NuTao group, Uncle ......
Looks like my charm is still intact hahahahahahahaha!
Thank you so much then.]
Start -->1763223315188452[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Oh - is this a special goodie for Uncle? Thanks a lot!
Then I'll take it with pleasure!]
Start -->1763223315189480[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

I don't need anything, but you've just arrived in Seikyu and you're in need of money ......
Based on our friendship, if you don't have a gift, won't I cover you?]
Start -->1763223315189482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Although you are doing this out of the goodness of your heart, ......
It seems like it's hard to cheer up an uncle by receiving this kind of gift.]
Start -->1763223315190508[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

If it were in the past ............
Such a gift would have been the trigger for two gangs to go to war.]
Start -->1763223315190510[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

The last time I received such a complimentary gift was at my retirement ceremony.
Thank you for taking the trouble ...... Uncle is very touched.]
Start -->1763223315190512[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Looks like you've really had a good look into the hobbies of an older man ......
What an uptight little guy hahahahahaha!
Thanks for the birthday present!]
Start -->1763223315191538[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Is this your birthday gift to Uncle?
Thank you very much. ...... Uncle will take it well.]
Start -->1763223315191540[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

As long as you can remember Uncle's birthday, Uncle will be satisfied!]
Start -->1763223315191542[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

You should be thankful that Uncle I've become quite a bit more mild-tempered over the years ......]
Start -->1763223315192568[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Okay, that's all we're going to talk about today.]
Start -->1763223315192570[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Farewell.]
Start -->1763223315193596[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

Don't forget to stop by and chat with Uncle sometime.]
