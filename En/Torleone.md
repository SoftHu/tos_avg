\nI should shove off! Farewell.]
Start -->1775525237421761[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMay the sea be still and the wind at your back.]
Start -->1775525237421765[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWhat a heart-warming expression of loyalty! You've won a powerful ally today, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. Thank you.]
Start -->1775525237421769[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nA generous offering. This would have won you a spot on my crew back in the day. Thank you. I'll not soon forget it.]
Start -->1775525237421773[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThis is a perfectly adequate tribute. Thank you.]
Start -->1775525237421777[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nHmm try harder next time. Or don't try at all.]
Start -->1775525237421781[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIn the old days I would have fought anyone who gave me such a rediculous offering. Now I'll just say, 'No, thank you' and try to forget this insult.]
Start -->1775525237421785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nHappy carp festival! I'm flying a flag for Seabert today. Be sure to wish him well.]
Start -->1775525237421789[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe Carp festival actually has very little to do with fish. It's a shame really. Anyway, enjoy yourself.]
Start -->1775525237421793[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe fish shop is only open in the mornings beacuse we sell most our catch by midday. So make sure ya wake up early.]
Start -->1775525237421797[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI've joined Heph's fitness club to stay in peak physical condition. I want Seabert to join but he's afraid he'll get squished. Poor kid.]
Start -->1775525237421801[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI take Seabert and the boys fishing every weekend. It's good for morale and if our catch is bigger than Musashi's... well, all the better.]
Start -->1775525237421805[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nDamned crates! When I catch the rogue who stuck me with 'em, he'll think twice about crossing Torleone again.]
Start -->1775525237421809[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIs Heph lifting more than me? Can't have 'em thinking I've lost my edge. I'm no lazy old uncle, see!]
Start -->1775525237421813[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nSeabert, Prince, and Uozomi are like my little crew. The Stormwave gang lives on! Perhaps you'd like to join one day?]
Start -->1775525237421817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nTime and tide wait for no Yokai. If you want something... take it.]
Start -->1775525237421821[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWhen the sun sets, it's time for a drink.]
Start -->1775525237421825[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nRainy days are like doldrums at sea, the key is to keep your mind busy.]
Start -->1775525237421829[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThis is a gift worthy of 'the Godfather of the Sea'. Thank you, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421833[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThank you for the birthday tribute, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421837[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMy birthday was once celebrated by the whole Stormwave gang. Now I get mediocre gifts. Don't get old, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI don't like this at all. Maybe the fish will find some use for it when I throw it into the sea.]
Start -->1775525237421845[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMy heart swells with pride to receive such a birthday present. You've made aging far more bearable, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. Please accept my deepest gratitude--old sea dog that I am!]
Start -->1775525237421849[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI left Prince looking after the shop. I should get back before he hurts himself.]

\nMiss Ama makes the most brilliant Summer dresses... Not that I'm interested in that kind of thing!]
Start -->1775525237421873[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe ocean is warmest in Autumn. Good for swiming but bad for storms. The sea is a mysterious woman I tell ya.]
Start -->1775525237421877[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe cold makes me crave oysters. I've half a mind to open a kakigoya right here in Seikyu.]
Start -->1775525237421881[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI used to drink beer but now I'll take a glass of wine with a seafood dinner anyday.]
Start -->1775525237421885[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nVegatables aren't my favorite. The gang always ate meat when I was in charge and they loved me for it!]

\nKeep an eye out for scoundrels, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. You don't become 'The Godfather of the Sea' without a second sense for these kinds of things.]
Start -->1775525237421909[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nToday's gym day. And if a certain dress-maker sees me looking manly and swashbuckling... well, so be it.]
Start -->1775525237421913[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI love getting out on the water and smelling the salty air!]
Start -->1775525237421917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThose crates still torment me. The black spot on the Stormwave gang's great legacy.]
Start -->1775525237421921[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWorking out helps keep my mind off of &lt;i&gt;you know who&lt;/i&gt;. Thank you for helping me with my &lt;i&gt;situation&lt;/i&gt;.]
Start -->1775525237421925[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nYou should fish with us today! Seabert really looks up to you. The boy is a good judge of character.]

\nSummer belongs to the youthful. Watching ya crusade around brings a smile to my face.]
Start -->1775525237421945[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI thought Summer love was a young man's game but I'm reduced to a quivering schoolboy when I'm around her! Can you believe it?]
Start -->1775525237421949[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIt's sea urchin season. I could have some put aside for you if you like.]
Start -->1775525237421953[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nAny news? I want to catch that scoundrel before the holes up for the cold season.]
Start -->1775525237421957[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe sea is calm in Winter. Maybe I'll teach Seabert to how to sail. Wouldn't that be something.]
Start -->1775525237421961[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nUozumi talks of flying home for Winter. We need him to help stockpile fish but he misses his family. Being a leader means making tough decisions.]
Start -->1777917301615122[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI dream of shellfish... any kind.]
Start -->1777918151965206[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI have no use for rocks and minerals. You're better off giving that stuff to Heph.]
Start -->1777918170937882[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe sea is truly my happy place!]
