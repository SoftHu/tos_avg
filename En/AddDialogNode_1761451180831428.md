Alas... the sunlight is so beautiful and the sea is so blue, but my time is running out.
I can but behold them one last time so that I don't have regrets before I die.]

1761452227087048 -->|Theo? Is that you?|1761452523136717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Looks like you mistook me for my elder brother. I don't blame you.
The three of us are twins. I'm Taji, the second twin. It's nice to meet you, 
but I'm afraid you won't be seeing me again anytime soon.]
1761452227087048 -->|Shouldn't you be working at the casino?|1761452523136717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

You mean my hometown? Well, kind of.
Life is a journey, and death is just returning to the beginning.
To tell you the truth, my days are numbered...]

1761453290044114 -->|What are you doing?|1761453413620439[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Actually, I've had health issues since I was a kid.
Lately I've been feeling weak and it seems like the end is near.]
1761453290044114 -->|What? Are you kidding me?|1761453413620439[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

1761453982656216 -->|I might be able to help?|1761456921394911[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

There is a legend in Satsuma that the Shinto priest at Seikyu Shrine 
has the power to revive the dead. And those who are terminally ill can 
be cured with his blessing. But why would a Shinto priest want to help me?
Maybe no one can save me. I'll simply wait for death to knock on my door...]
