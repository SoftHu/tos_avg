Alas ...... the sun is so good, the sea is so blue, but my time is running out.
I can only see it one more time so that I don't have regrets before I die.]

1761452227087048 -->|Tiff? Is that you?|1761452523136717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Looks like you mistook me for my elder brother. No wonder.
The three of us are twins. I'm Taji, the second.
It's nice to meet you, but I'm afraid you won't be seeing me anytime soon.]
1761452227087048 -->|Shouldn't you be working at the casino?|1761452523136717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

1761452770671310 -->|What for? Are you going back home?|1761452795966161[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Old home? ...... is considered old home, right?
Life is a journey, and death is just a return to the beginning.
To tell you the truth, I don't have long to live ......]

1761453290044114 -->|What's wrong?|1761453413620439[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Actually, I've been in bad health since I was a kid.

1761453290044114 -->|Hey? It's really not true!|1761453413620439[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Actually, I've been in bad health since I was a kid.

1761453982656216 -->|I might be able to help?|1761456921394911[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

There is a legend in Satsuma that the Shinto priest at Seikyu Shrine has the power to bring the dead back to life.
Those who are terminally ill can be cured with his blessing.
But why would a Shinto priest want to help an unknown person?
Maybe no one can save me, I'll just wait to die ......]
