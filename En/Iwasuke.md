Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727647236932709[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727647236932711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727647236933737[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727647236933739[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727647236933741[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727647236933743[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1727650072682653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

See you later...]
Start -->1727650135842975[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Ah...! This, this, this... isn't this... 
Hey? Who are you?]
Start -->1727650258770081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I haven't seen you around here before.
New here? Let me give you some pointers.
Firstly, maintain respect for Inari-sama.
Pay homage at her shrine, let her feel your devotion.
Of course, making wishes is permitted too.
Also, remember to make good use of the consignment box.
Boss &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; is everyone's god of fortune.
Heaven knows how he manages to sell our junk!]

I heard there's a casino opening in town...
I'm both thrilled and concerned.
Glad that we finally have some decent entertainment facilities...
The trouble is...
I don't have any money to play in the casino!
So what do I care?]
Start -->1753042419514152[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Yay, it's the Carp Festival!
Later, I'm going to sign up with Torleone for the Carp Flag capturing event.
You should try it out if you have the time!]
Start -->1753042753954601[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

All right, no more time to chat.
Happy Carp Festival!]
Start -->1758172556012100[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The mask stall is a must-visit, they have many new designs this year. I'm thinking about giving one a try.]
Start -->1758175820284486[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's a rare opportunity, so relax and have fun. Enjoy the summer festival!]
Start -->1763923720742699[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You have to believe that every investment you make in me is worth something.
I'll show you the return.]
Start -->1763923720742701[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You're very discerning!
Whether it's picking out a gift, or picking out a friend.]
Start -->1763923720743727[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Thanks for taking care of me ......
I won't forget you when I'm rich.]
Start -->1763923720743729[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You know what?
The truth is that the whole gift-giving thing is really a learning experience.]
Start -->1763923720743731[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Although I'm a nobody in Seikyu ......
But I can't be bullied by you like this, right?]
Start -->1763923720744757[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Actually, I didn't even celebrate birthdays much before
But after coming to Seikyu, somehow I actually started enjoying every second of being alive too.
Thank you for the gift!]
Start -->1763923720744759[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; And got me a birthday present.
I didn't realize you cared more about me than my brothers, thanks a lot.]
Start -->1763923720745785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I didn't expect &lbrace;playername&rbrace; to remember my birthday ......
I will never forget your kindness in times of trouble.]
Start -->1763923720745787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I really should be happy to receive a gift ......]
Start -->1763923720746813[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Don't be a party pooper on my birthday, okay?]
Start -->1763923720746815[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Bye. Good luck.]
Start -->1763923720746817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Lady Luck will favor you.]
Start -->1763923720747843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>
