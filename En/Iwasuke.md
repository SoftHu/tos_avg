Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727647236932709[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727647236932711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727647236933737[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727647236933739[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727647236933741[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727647236933743[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1727650072682653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

See you later...]
Start -->1727650135842975[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

Ah...! This, this, this... isn't this... 
Hey? Who are you?]
Start -->1727650258770081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

You look like a stranger,
new here. Let me give you some pointers.
Firstly, maintain respect for Inari-sama.
Pay homage at her shrine, let her feel your devotion.
Of course, making wishes is also okay.
Also, remember to make good use of the consignment box.
Boss &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; is everyone's god of wealth.
Heaven knows how he sells our junk!]

I heard there's a casino opening in town...
I'm both thrilled and concerned.
Glad that we finally have some decent entertainment facilities...
The trouble is...
I don't have any money to play in the casino!
What does that have to do with me?]

Yay, it's the Carp Festival!
Later, I'm going to sign up with Torleone for the Carp Flag capturing event.
You should try it out if you have the time!]
Start -->1753042753954601[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>

All right, no more time to chat.
Happy Carp Festival!]

The mask stall is a must-visit, they have many new designs this year. I'm thinking about picking one to wear.]

It's a rare opportunity, so relax and have fun. Enjoy the summer festival!]
