\nOh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]

\nThank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727647236932711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Iwasuke:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]

\nAlthough I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]

\nAre you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]

\nIt feels like my relationship with &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; has grown closer... 
Let's keep getting along well from now on!]

\nI did something unnecessary... 
It feels like my relationship with &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; has become distant!]

\nSee you laterâ€¦]

\nWhoa...! Isn't this... Wait, who are you again?]

\nYou look unfamiliar, so I know you're not from around here. New to town? Let me give you some advice.\nFirst, you must show respect to Lady Inari. When you pass by her shrine, make sure to pay your respects and let her feel your sincerity. Of course, you can also make a wish to her.\nNext, remember to make good use of the consignment box. &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; is our town's money master. Who knows how he manages to sell off all the random things for us.]

\nI've heard that the town is opening a casino... I'm feeling both excited and worried about it.\nI'm excited because we're finally getting a proper entertainment venue...\nBut I'm worried... because I don't have any money to spend at the casino! What's it got to do with me anyway?]
