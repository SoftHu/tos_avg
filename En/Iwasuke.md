Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727647236932709[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727647236932711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727647236933739[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]

It feels like my relationship with &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; has grown closer... 
Let's keep getting along well from now on!]
Start -->1727647236933743[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... 
It feels like my relationship with &lbrace;npc.4215&rbrace; has become distant!]
Start -->1727650072682653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

See you laterâ€¦]
Start -->1727650135842975[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Whoa...! Isn't this... Wait, who are you again?]
Start -->1727650258770081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You look unfamiliar, so I know you're not from around here. New to town? Let me give you some advice.
First, you must show respect to Lady Inari. When you pass by her shrine, make sure to pay your respects and let her feel your sincerity. Of course, you can also make a wish to her.
Next, remember to make good use of the consignment box. &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; is our town's money master. Who knows how he manages to sell off all the random things for us.]

I've heard that the town is opening a casino... I'm feeling both excited and worried about it.
I'm excited because we're finally getting a proper entertainment venue...
But I'm worried... because I don't have any money to spend at the casino! What's it got to do with me anyway?]

The mask stall is a must-visit, they have many new designs this year. 
I'm thinking about giving one a try.]

It's a rare opportunity, so relax and have fun. Enjoy the summer festival!]
