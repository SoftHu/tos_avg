\nThe first dish is spicy seafood pasta~ I personally think the spiciness is just right, 
but I'm worried that the guests might not find it impactful enough...\nWhat do you think, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;?]
1757655458919025 -->|This is too spicy! &#40;breathing fire&#41;|1757656448902775[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>
\nReally? Is it that intense? But indeed, not everyone can handle spiciness well. 
Maybe I should reduce the amount of chili.]
1757655458919025 -->|I think it can be spicier...|1757656589291128[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>
\nYou're right, we should offer a unique experience! 
Spice that explodes like fireworks, leaving a lasting impression.]

Wagyu beef from the Kyoto region as the main ingredient.
Many thanks to the Kujou Group for their sponsorship!\nWhen it comes to Wagyu beef, you might think,
&quot;premium ingredients should be cooked in simple ways.&quot;
