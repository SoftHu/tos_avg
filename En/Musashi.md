Yo! Boss.
Want to buy something? I'll give you a discount.]
Start -->1727291147076726[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Hello! How may I assist you today?]
Start -->1727291147077752[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Quality wares at a reasonable price!
I'm Musashi, the town vendor.
You name it, I have it!]
Start -->1727291147077754[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Boss, you're here!
What would you like today?]
Start -->1727291438940284[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Feel free to reach out to me...
]
Start -->1727291569674366[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727291569674368[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727291569675394[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727291569675396[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727291569675398[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727291569675400[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727291569676426[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1727291716105364[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I assume you've met Mr. Torleone?
He's one tough looking man, but the kids all love him.
Ah, I wonder if the rascals would like me as an old man...]

The Carp Festival is Seikyu's big annual event!
Legend has it that a carp, once it passes through the Dragon
Gate and is tested, transforms into a dragon.]
Start -->1753035128592157[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't forget to sign up for the Carp Festival activities with &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;...
Have fun, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!]

Not everyone has the chance to escape the past and start a new life. 
In a way, we're quite similar.
If it weren't for Aoba accepting us, we might still be wandering somewhere. 
Don't get me wrong, I mean you're lucky.]
Start -->1756941066785862[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't you think Mayor Oda is not as simple as she appears? 
Of course, I'm just gossiping. No malice intended...
After all, no one's perfect. 
If she appears flawless, she must be hiding something.]
Start -->1756941191416905[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I'll tell you a secret, actually, my business in Aoba is all at friendship prices. 
I don't make any profit... At most, I break even.
Everyone trusts me so much, how could I profit off them? 
Of course, I have other sources of income. Don't worry about me.]
Start -->1756949268805708[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Good morning! You should be getting used to life in Aoba by now. 
Although it's not as bustling as Shikoku and Kyushu...
But it offers a rare leisure and freedom. 
No need to worry about deceit and scheming, 
or not being able to pay next month's rent.]
Start -->1756950644137039[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I lived in Kyoto for a while, and the local customs left a deep impression on me. 
But what impressed me most was the traditional afternoon tea.
Even now, I often ask friends in Kyoto to bring me local wagashi. 
Every time I eat them, I'm momentary transported back there..]
Start -->1757013227238482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Fine wine and gambling are great for passing the time, 
especially on long, lonely nights... But I advise you to refrain from overindulgence.
I've seen people overindulge, seen them fall into the abyss. 
If you think you can resist their temptation, you're gravely mistaken.]
Start -->1757013464181844[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Another annoyingly sunny day... 
I really hate being exposed to sunlight. 
It feels like being burned by the sun's fiery gaze.]
Start -->1757013626560600[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I quite enjoy walking alone in the rain. 
The atmosphere is somber. It feels like I've become a lone warrior.]
Start -->1757738132271703[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

It's very fortunate to be able to drink Miss Shuten's sake... 
No exaggeration. I'm serious!
I bet even Lady Inari would share the same sentiments 
if she came here for a drink.]
Start -->1758070072263213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't hang around here... Why not have a few drinks?]
Start -->1758070108711471[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Friends from outside the island are also interested in Miss Shuten's creations... 
I've been trying to facilitate cooperation between them, 
but Miss Shuten has no interest.]
Start -->1758089051778653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh? Are you here to try your luck too? 
But let it be known, this place seems to have some kind of magical hold on people.
Be careful not to be consumed by greed.]
Start -->1758090103277151[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't you think it's strange for a casino of this scale to appear in Aoba? 
The true owner's identity must be someone special.]
Start -->1758178510372433[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I've attended many summer festivals in various places. 
Each region has its own characteristics and atmosphere, 
but I still like Aoba's summer festival the most.]
Start -->1758178871818835[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Wish you a wonderful night.]
