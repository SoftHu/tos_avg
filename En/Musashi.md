Yo! Boss.
Want to buy something? I'll give you a discount.]
Start -->1727291147076726[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Hello! How may I assist you today?]
Start -->1727291147077752[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

None]
Start -->1727291147077754[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Boss, you're here!
What would you like today?]
Start -->1727291438940284[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Feel free to reach out to me...

Start -->1727291569674366[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727291569674368[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727291569675394[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727291569675396[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727291569675398[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727291569675400[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727291569676426[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; now!]

The Carp Festival is Seikyu's big annual event!
Legend has it that a carp, once it passes through the Dragon
Gate and is tested, turns into a dragon.]
Start -->1753035128592157[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't forget to sign up for the Carp Festival activities with &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;...
Have fun, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!]

Not everyone has the chance to escape the past and start a new life. In a way, we're quite similar.
If it weren't for Aoba accepting us, we might still be wandering somewhere. Don't get me wrong, I mean you're lucky.]
Start -->1756941066785862[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't you think Mayor Oda is not as simple as she seems? Of course, I'm just gossiping. No malice intended...
After all, no one can be perfect. If she appears flawless, she must be hiding some secret.]
Start -->1756941191416905[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I'll tell you a secret, actually, my business in Aoba is all at friendship prices. I don't make any profit... At most, I break even.
Everyone trusts me so much, how could I make money off them? Of course, I have other sources of income. Don't worry about my life.]
Start -->1756949268805708[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Good morning! You should be getting used to life in Aoba by now. Although it's not as bustling as Shikoku and Kyushu...
But it offers a rare leisure and freedom. No need to worry about deceit and scheming, or not being able to pay next month's rent.]

I lived in Kyoto for a while, and the local customs left a deep impression on me. But what impressed me most was the traditional afternoon tea.
Even now, I often ask friends in Kyoto to bring me local wagashi. Every time I eat them, it feels like I'm back in Kyoto.]
Start -->1757013227238482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Fine wine and gambling are great for passing the time, especially on lonely long nights... But I advise you not to indulge too much.
I've seen people who get deeply involved. Those two things are like an abyss. If you think you can resist temptation, you're gravely mistaken.]
Start -->1757013464181844[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Another annoying sunny day... I really hate being exposed to the sunlight. It feels like being burned by sharp gazes.]
Start -->1757013626560600[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I quite enjoy walking alone in the rain. The atmosphere is great. It feels like I've become a lone warrior.]
Start -->1757738132271703[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

It's very fortunate to be able to drink Miss Shuten's sake... Sounds exaggerated, right? But it's true!
I bet even the god Inari would say the same thing if they came here for a drink.]
Start -->1758070072263213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't hang around here... Why not have a few drinks?]
Start -->1758070108711471[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Friends from outside the island are also interested in Miss Shuten's creations... I've been trying to facilitate cooperation between them, but Miss Shuten has no interest.]
Start -->1758089051778653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Oh? Are you here to try your luck too? To be honest, this place seems to have a magic that makes people reluctant to leave...
Be careful not to be consumed by greed.]
Start -->1758090103277151[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Don't you think it's strange for a casino of this scale to appear in Aoba? Have you ever thought... maybe the true owner's identity is special?]
Start -->1758178510372433[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

I've attended many summer festivals in various places. Each region has its own characteristics and atmosphere, but I still like Aoba's summer festival the most.]
Start -->1758178871818835[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

Wish you a wonderful night.]
