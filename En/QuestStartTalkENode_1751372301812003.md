Start -->1751377615148325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nMorning, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. 
I'm happy to see you well.\nI heard you've been exploring the &lbrace;location.10&rbrace;. 
It's dangerous there, eh? I was a little worried about you.]
1751377615148325 -->|I didn't have any trouble.|1751378039158059[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI wish the renovations on my forge were finished. 
I could help you if it were up and running.]
1751377615148325 -->|It's a bit tricky down there.|1751378039158059[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI wish the renovations on my forge were finished. 
I could help you if it were up and running.]
1751378039158059 -->|Weapons would be helpfulâ€¦|1771882614715479[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHo, fantastic! Thanks, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.
Bring the material to the shop when you have it.\nI'm going to prepare the forge now.
See you soon!]
1751378039158059 -->| Can I help with the renovation?|1771882614715479[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHo, fantastic! Thanks, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.
Bring the material to the shop when you have it.\nI'm going to prepare the forge now.
See you soon!]

1751378329793842 -->1751442595199554[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;, you are a very important friend to me. I'll be happy to help you.\nRemember I said I was planning to open a workshop in town?
I'd like to hear your opinion on some things.]
1751442595199554 -->|Can I really be of help?|1751442854535753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI trust &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;'s judgement!\nFirst, the location of the shop. What do you think?]
1751442595199554 -->|I'd be honoured...|1751442854535753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI trust &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;'s judgement!\nFirst, the location of the shop. What do you think?]
1751442854535753 -->|A quiet alley.|1751443333373520[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHmm, that makes sense.
A quiet environment will allow me to focus on my work...]
1751442854535753 -->|A busy street corner.|1751443330296399[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHmm, that makes sense.
A good location will mean more people notice my work...]
1751443330296399 -->1751443519333969[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nNext up, business direction. Although my strength is in forging blades,
it seems the town doesn't really need them. So besides forging weapons, 
I'm thinking of preparing some everyday goods. What do you think I should sell?]
1751443519333969 -->|Practical tools.|1751444020978263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nThat's a good choice. I'll seriously consider your suggestion.\nThe last issue is also my biggest dilemma:
Should my sign bear Muramasa's name or my own? 
Master Muramasa's name is well-known, nobody knows &lbrace;npc.4106&rbrace;...]
1751443519333969 -->|Exquisite crafts.|1751444020978263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Master Muramasa's name is well-known, nobody knows &lbrace;npc.4106&rbrace;...]
1751444020978263 -->|Or a Muramasa signboard is more appealing.|1751444372518497[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nEven &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace; says so? 
Ah... well, thanks for the advice.]
1751444020978263 -->|With it you can fully enjoy the pleasure of fishing.|1751444367376992[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;, saying that really inspires me!
This is very important to me.]
1751444367376992 -->1751444603660898[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nNow I'll go back and start preparing for the workshop!
I hope it won't be long before I can invite you to the opening ceremony.]
