Start -->1751377615148325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I heard you just came back from the underground ruins.
That seems dangerous. I was worried about you so I came to check on you.]
1751377615148325 -->1751377976218918{ }
1751377976218918 -->|It's a bit tricky...|1751378039158059[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Is there anything I can help you with? 
Like, do you need any weapons or gear...?]
1751377976218918 -->|No worries!|1751378039158059[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Is there anything I can help you with?

1751378039158059 -->1751378152975660{ }
1751378152975660 -->|I really need your help.|1751442595199554[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, you are a very important friend to me. I'll be happy to help you.
Remember I said I was planning to open a workshop in town?
I'd like to hear your opinion on some things.]
1751378152975660 -->|Would that be too much trouble for you?|1751442595199554[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, you are a very important friend to me. I'll be happy to help you.

1751442595199554 -->1751442781538884{ }
1751442781538884 -->|I'd be honoured...|1751442854535753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I trust &lbrace;playername&rbrace;'s judgement!
First, the location of the shop. What do you think?]
1751442781538884 -->|Can I really be of help?|1751442854535753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

1751442854535753 -->1751443266504266{ }
1751443266504266 -->|A busy street corner|1751443330296399[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Hmm, that makes sense.
A good location will mean more people notice my work...]
1751443266504266 -->|A quiet alley|1751443333373520[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Hmm, that makes sense.
A quiet environment will allow me to focus on my work...]
1751443330296399 -->1751443519333969[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Next up, business direction. Although my strength is in forging blades,
it seems the town doesn't really need them.
So besides forging weapons, I'm thinking of preparing some everyday goods. What do you think I should sell?]
1751443519333969 -->1751443624437330{ }
1751443624437330 -->|Exquisite crafts|1751444020978263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

That's a good choice. I'll seriously consider your suggestion.
The last issue is also my biggest dilemma:
Should my sign bear Muramasa's name or my own? 
Master Muramasa's name is well-known, nobody knows Hephaestus...]

1751444236070488 -->|With it you can fully enjoy the pleasure of fishing.|1751444367376992[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, saying that really inspires me!
This is very important to me.]
1751444236070488 -->|Or a Muramasa signboard is more appealing.|1751444372518497[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Even &lbrace;playername&rbrace; says so? 
Ah... well, thanks for the advice.]
1751444367376992 -->1751444603660898[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Now I'll go back and start preparing for the workshop!
I hope it won't be long before I can invite you to the opening ceremony.]
