Of course I know gambling is a rotten habit.
To be honest, I loathe it.
It's just that right now, the three of us aren't gainfully employed.
No matter what, we need a place of our own in Seikyu first.
Think of it as seed money I earned with the help of this book.
Now, this is the coin purse my mother left me before she died.
I kept some of the money, and the rest is your payment.]
