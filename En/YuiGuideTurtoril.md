There's Sasaki's Funiture Studio,

Those are our cottages! 
Seikyu is known for its lovely housesâ€¦ nothing compared to your farmhouse though. 
And you know where Torleone's isâ€¦ 
so I think that's it for our tour!

Do be sure to say hi to everyone in town. 
Everyone here has been so excited to meet you!

I think some have even been building new places to make Seikyu as good as it can be for youâ€¦ make sure to talk to them, ok?]
