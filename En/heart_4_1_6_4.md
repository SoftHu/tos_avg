\nWelcome, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!
Not bad, eh?
\nI wanted you to be the first to see it since you helped make it happen. 
So here's the anvil, my tools, and whetstones,
Over there is the furnace and smelting holds. 
\nThis forge rivals that of Master Muramasa. 
What do you think?

1772236618104917 -->|A forge fit for a master craftsman!  |1772236750704731[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYou're too kind.

1772236618104917 -->|Is all this really necessary? |1772236788055132[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYou're hard to please, eh, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;?

1772236750704731 -->1772236835773535[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHow about I show you what she can do?
Maybe you'll even learn something.

\nI've always known exactly what I wanted,
and I've always charged right at my heart's desire. 
Take this forge for exampleâ€¦
\nI've become a craftsman through sheer force of will. 
But I will not be a true master until I've created a Muramasa blade. 
\nAnd for the first time, I cannot reach my dreams alone.
I can only wait for a swordsman worthy of the inscription. 
After a life of charging, I can only wait for the right person to appear. 
\nI must rely on another to fulfill my life's purpose. 
â€¦

\nIt's much like love, isn't it?

1772237475405913 -->|Relying on others can be beautiful.|1772237645806689[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYou can hone your craft and sharpen yourself,
But you can't will that person to appearâ€“
The worthy swordsman or your soul's companionâ€“ 
\nThe Muramasa blade is like romance in that way. 
Something you can't charge at. 
No matter how much your heart burns for it.

\nâ€¦
There.
The blade is finished. 
\nYou should keep it.  ]

\nThanks for listening, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
My mind wanders when I'm smithing.
\nOh, I forgot to show you my special ore cabinet. 
It's where I keep the special iron we collected earlier.

I was saving that to make a Muramasa blade.
Who could have stolen it?
