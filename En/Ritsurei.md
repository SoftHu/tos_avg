\nLeaving? Remember to come and play with me again, boss.]
Start -->1727663191522397[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nOh! Boss!]
Start -->1727663191522399[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nWhat are we doing today!]
Start -->1727663191522401[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nI'm waiting for you, boss! So where are we going?]
Start -->1727663191523427[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nHehe... you're here!]
Start -->1727663570583653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nBoss, have you read 'Dungeon Hero Lola'?
The comic is hugely popular,
but the author's identity remains a mystery.\nIt's about Lora, a hero born and stuck in a dungeon,
determined to defeat the evil deity keeping her there, 
so that she can finally escape.\nI wish I could be a hero too...
Defeat the evil monster, carve my name on its heart...
How cool would that be!]
Start -->1727663570584679[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nKinntarou can communicate with animals...
Though I don't know how he does it!\nI'm just hopeless.
No matter how hard I try to understand them, 
I can only hear miaows and barks. I envy Kinntarou!]
Start -->1727663570584681[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nI've never met my mum and dad.
I don't even know what they look like
or who they really are.\nWhy don't they come see me and Kinntarou...?
Have we really been abandoned?]
Start -->1727663570585707[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nBoss, I heard you lost your memories of the past?
Are you from another world?
You're not a comic book hero, are you?\nHeroes in comics always have companions.
Can I be yours?]

\nMiss Ama designed some new children's clothes
and asked me to model them for her.
She posted the photos on her studio's official website.\nEveryone says the model looks handsome and cute...
Maybe I should consider a career as a professional model?]

\nLately, it feels like someone's watching me.
Not sure if it's just my imagination.
A shadowy figure, sneaking around... Scary stuff!]
Start -->1727664540707953[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nOh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727664540707955[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nThank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727664540708981[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727664540708983[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nAlthough I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727664540708985[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nAre you deliberately trying to humiliate me?
You're making me angry!]
Start -->1727664540710011[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727664540710013[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753123996238240[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nBoss, are you here for the Carp Festival too?
Mum says it's a festival for boys to grow strong.
&lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace; and I will surely be blessed!]
Start -->1753124773238177[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nAll right, that's enough chat for now.
Don't forget to participate in the activities at Uncle &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;'s.
Wonder if I can win first place this year!]
Start -->1758253420255841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nBoss, I knew you'd come to the summer festival! 
How about the atmosphere in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;? It's better than anywhere else, right?]
Start -->1758254460936803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsurei:</b>
\nAlright, if you find something fun, don't forget to call me.]
