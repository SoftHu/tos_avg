Leaving? Remember to come and play with me again, boss.]
Start -->1727663191522397[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Oh! Boss!]
Start -->1727663191522399[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

What are we doing today!]
Start -->1727663191522401[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

I'm waiting for you, boss! Where are we going to play?]
Start -->1727663191523427[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Hehe... you're here!]
Start -->1727663570583653[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Boss, have you read 'Dungeon Hero Lola'?
The comic is hugely popular,
but the author's identity remains a mystery.
It's about Lora, a hero born in a dungeon,
determined to defeat the evil deity on her own
and finally escape the dungeon.
I wish I could be a hero too...
Defeat the evil deity, carve my name on its heart...
How cool would that be!]
Start -->1727663570584679[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Kinntarou can communicate with animals...
Though I don't know how he does it!
I'm just hopeless.
No matter how hard I try to understand them, I can only hear miaows and barks.
I envy Kinntarou!]
Start -->1727663570584681[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

I've never seen my mum and dad.
I don't even know what they look like
or who they really are.
Why not come see me and Kinntarou?
Have we really been abandoned?]
Start -->1727663570585707[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Boss, I heard you lost your memories of the past?
Are you from another world?
You're not a comic book hero, are you?
Heroes in comics always have companions.
Can I be yours?]

Miss Ama designed some new children's clothes
and asked me to model them for her.
She posted the photos on her studio's official website.
Everyone says the model looks handsome and cute...
Maybe I should consider a career as a professional model?]
Start -->1727663570585711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Lately, it feels like someone's secretly watching me.
Not sure if it's just my imagination.
A shadowy figure, sneaking around... Scary stuff!]
Start -->1727664540707953[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727664540707955[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727664540708981[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727664540708983[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727664540708985[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Are you deliberately trying to humiliate me?
You're making me angry!]
Start -->1727664540710011[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727664540710013[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753123996238240[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Boss, are you here for the Carp Festival too?
Mum says it's a festival for boys to grow strong.
&lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace; and I will surely be blessed!]
Start -->1753124773238177[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

All right, that's enough chat for now.
Don't forget to participate in the activities at Uncle &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;'s.
Wonder if I can win first place this year!]
Start -->1758253420255841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Boss, I knew you'd come to the summer festival! How about the atmosphere in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;? It's better than anywhere else, right?]
Start -->1758254460936803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ritsuryo:</b>

Alright, if you find something fun, don't forget to call me.]
