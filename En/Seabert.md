Do you watch the prime-time documentary channel?
There's a show about animal migration coming up.
Here's a secret - it was produced by my parents.]
Start -->1757998886755910[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

My uncle said he and my mom can hold their liquor.
Family genetics.
That means I'll be a heavyweight drinker too.]
Start -->1757999058116168[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I just love the free snacks at the tavern.
My favorite is kakinotane. It's so delicious that
my uncle would buy some for me to take home.
But when I eat it at home, it's just... meh.
Does the tavern somehow make snacks taste better?]
Start -->1758159149355629[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Is this the adult world?
I can't wait to grow up...]
Start -->1758254907850342[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I helped out with this year's Summer Festival!
&lbrace;npc.4209.first_name&rbrace; said I contributed
to the fun everybody was having.]
Start -->1758255297076840[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Gotta go, have fun!]
Start -->1763648884777694[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Although my uncle said &quot;don't accept gratification without merit&quot; ......
But if it's a gift from a friend
It would be rude not to accept it!]
Start -->1763648884778720[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Wow, it's Seabert's favorite gift. ......
Seabert loves you!]
Start -->1763648884779746[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I don't know why you're giving me a gift ......
But I'll take it for now!]
Start -->1763648884779748[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's hard for Seabert to receive this kind of stuff ......]
Start -->1763648884780774[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Why are you bullying Seabert ......
Hm! Is it because Seabert is so cute? Damn it!]
Start -->1763648884780776[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Wow! Is this Seabert's birthday present?
I'm so happy, I'm going to take a picture to remember this wonderful moment. ......
By the way, I have to tell mom, dad and uncle.]
Start -->1763648884780778[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

A present? What a coincidence. How did you know it was Seabert's birthday? ......
Hey? Could this be the birthday present!]
Start -->1763648884781804[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's Seabert's birthday today and it's so nice to get a gift from &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1763648884781806[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Birthday gift words ......
It's either that or forget it.]
Start -->1763648884781808[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

If I bully Seabert, I'll tell uncle!]
Start -->1763648884782834[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

See you later. Make sure you come back and play with Seabert again!]
Start -->1763648884782836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Bye-bye!]
Start -->1763648884783862[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Well, it looks like you're busy, so it's okay to talk about it another time.]
Start -->1766314315970305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Hello! What can I do for Seabert?
I'm not very good at solving problems.
But I'm good at helping you get rid of your worries!]
Start -->1766314315970307[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Even the most cheerful person will have times when he is in a bad mood, so if you are really troubled, go to the wilderness and look at the scenery!
Looking at the beauty of Seikyu, all your worries will dissipate.
Let's go hiking together if you have a chance, I have several routes I can recommend to you.]
Start -->1766315082127224[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My uncle always treats me like a child and
never lets me help out at the shop...
He's like, &quot;This isn't kid stuff.&quot;
I was trying to help him out.
But he didn't appreciate it at all!
I'm sorry, I said something disturbing.]
Start -->1766315231277946[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Every now and then, a couple of tough guys come to my uncle's store.
At first I thought they were looking for trouble.
I was worried about how to solve the problem!
But it seems like they don't mean any harm ......
They even bring me good snacks.
You really can't judge a person by their appearance ......
]
Start -->1766315303044987[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My favorite festival is the Summer Festival!
Every year at the summer festival.
Musashi's brother prepares super beautiful fireworks.
The fireworks exploded in the sky with a bang.
The reflection of the fireworks on the surface of the sea, and then broken by the waves, I think it's super beautiful. ......
I wish I could record it with my camera!]
Start -->1766315169633145[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My uncle won't let me wander into the wilderness, saying that the mountains are much more dangerous than the sea.
Seikyu has many more scary rumors ......
It's almost more exaggerated than in comic books!
I'm trapped in town all the time. So boring.
I mean, there's so much to see in Seikyu.
Be a shame if I don't go check it out.]
Start -->1766314315973389[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Have you heard? Musashi's brother is planning to get in a batch of comic books from outside.
I wonder if there are any adventure titles that I like ......
It'd be nice if there were photography-related magazines. I'm planning to study up on it lately.]
Start -->1766314315974415[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Every year at this time my uncle takes me to the beach to swim ......
But this year I went by myself, hey, awesome!
I can't shrink behind my uncle as a kid forever.]
Start -->1766314315974417[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I actually really don't like summer very much ......
Every summer, the authors of Dungeon Adventures take a break from publishing, and I'm told they take the opportunity to take their families on vacation.
Ah ...... long hiatus, it's been a long time coming.]
Start -->1766314315975443[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Would love to have a camera, even if it's used, even if it's an older model it doesn't matter ......
Seikyu does seem to be a bit of a pain in the ass to shop for, though, which is one of the few downsides.]
Start -->1766314315975445[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

In the fall, the rain becomes less and the air becomes drier, so it's the perfect season to make smoked fish!
My uncle loves to eat my dried smoked fish, hehehe!
If you're interested, you can try making some too!]
Start -->1766314315976471[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

You know what? Fall is the season for taro cooking pots!
In my hometown, people would hold taro boils on the river bank, which was our way of celebrating the harvest.
That's an unforgettable memory ......]
Start -->1766314315976473[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Two days ago, Liliana's sister invited me to visit her studio.
Gosh! I didn't realize that she has created so many amazing works ......
I envy her for being able to focus on one thing for a long time, something I can't do.]
Start -->1766314315977499[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Uncle cares a lot about Ms. Ama then ......
He's always cool to everyone, but once he talks to Ms. Ama he gets flustered.
Why is that?]
Start -->1766314315977501[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My uncle always said that I would inherit everything from him in the future, but I don't plan to stay here forever.
In fact, I want to become a photographer and take pictures of beautiful places.
But if my uncle finds out, he'll be sad. ......]
Start -->1766314315978527[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Ah ...... don't know it's already winter.
I don't know when it will snow in Seikyu this year. I want to build a snowman so much!
Will you participate in the snowball fight competition this year?]
Start -->1766314315978529[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

The winter sea breeze is getting sharp, luckily I have thick fur to keep me warm.
You need to wear more clothes, naked human, so sad!]
Start -->1766314315979555[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My mom called me a little while ago to tell me that they're shooting lizards in the hot desert right now.
It must be tough in this heat.
But I did pass on the coolness of Seikyu to them over the phone!]
Start -->1766314315979557[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

In winter, the number of tourists coming into Seikyu has decreased, and sometimes no one comes for the whole day.
I was slightly bored at the pier. ......
Let's hope that by next spring, it will all be better.]
Start -->1766314315980583[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Actually, our race used to hibernate ......
Everyone would stock up on food early in the fall and find a warm cave to sleep in.
These days though, people don't waste their time sleeping.]
Start -->1766314315980585[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Hello, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
What a beautiful spring day with bright green as far as the eye can see.
I wish the camera I ordered would hurry up and arrive.]
Start -->1766314315981611[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I'm quite envious of Kintarou and Ritsuryo, after all, how can two brothers live together and not be lonely.
I also envy you, being able to live with your sister, and being able to talk about nothing between relatives of the same age.
Although my uncle is also very kind to me, he's not a very good listener.]
Start -->1766314315981613[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Not long ago, uncle told me about his past, that can be really shocking ......
I didn't realize that the famous Nu Tao group was actually formed by my uncle!
No wonder there are always some ferocious people appearing in the store from time to time, I thought they were here to collect protection money.]
Start -->1766314315982639[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Uozumi told me a lot about civet cats ......
Originally I thought civet cats could be friendly, but I didn't realize that the civet cat clan had done so many bad things!
No wonder Uncle Uozumi fled to live in Seikyu, I really hope he can bring his family over soon too.]
Start -->1766314315983665[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's been a while since I've seen Kitsuri, and Ritsuryo and Kintarou always ask about her.
Everyone cares about her, so you should bring her to town more often!
I'm sure she's looking forward to making new friends too.]
Start -->1766314315984691[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

A casino is going to be opened in the town, which sounds really worrying.
Uncle had said that gambling was bad and that it would cause many people to lose everything they had.
Why did Oda-san agree to this? Could she be suffering from something?]
Start -->1766314315984693[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Oh. - It's you! It's you!
It's getting really hot in the summer, and I've been in the middle of fur season lately, so I'm looking a little scruffy.
Don't worry, after this, I'll be Seabert again!]
Start -->1766314315985719[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Wow! It's been super hot this summer!
Ladies are worried about getting a tan. Luckily, I have sea otter fur to protect me from the sun!
Sea otter fur is waterproof and sunproof, so it's very convenient!]
Start -->1766314315985721[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I actually look forward to the rainy season because there is a probability of catching king crabs in this kind of weather Oh!
Every year my uncle picks out the biggest king crab to make a hot pot ......
I wonder if I'll have a chance to eat it this year!]
Start -->1766314315986747[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

The Prince's brother seems to have an unusual affection for you ......
He's already treated me like a hole in the tree more than once.
Keeps harping on how if he can't be lovers with you he might as well just die?]
Start -->1766314315986749[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My mom and dad heard that I was interested in photography and sent me so many photography related books.
Although I don't have a camera yet, I've already mastered the skills of using a camera in advance!
Hahaha, that's weird to say ......]
Start -->1766314315987775[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Now the tavern's stocking has been taken care of by Kintarou.
It's admirable to start managing the back kitchen at such a young age!
But Auntie Shuten is always drunk, so there's no way to give her these jobs, right?]
Start -->1766314315988801[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Uncle Hephaestus works out a lot with my uncle, and he said he could bring me along too when I get a little older.
&quot;How can a man not have muscles?!&quot; That's what he said. ......
But I still preferred being quiet than working out.]
Start -->1766314315988803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Oda-san brought me freshly baked cookies, and they were still warm when they arrived!
In a season like this, a cup of hot tea and a few cookies make for a relaxing time ......
This may be the romance of a small town, right?]
Start -->1766314315988805[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

The vending machines on the street always have a constant supply of drinks and snacks ......
But I've never seen anyone restocking the machines hey!
That's a real unanswered question for Seikyu!]
Start -->1766314315988807[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My uncle is planning to organize a winter swimming competition, where the cold weather can sharpen our will!
But it seems that very few people have signed up for it. It's so strange, do people not like winter swimming?
Are you interested ...... Well, looking at your expression there isn't much interest.]
Start -->1766314315988809[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I hear humans hunt sea otters and make clothes out of our pelts ......
Oh, my God! That's so scary, I'm shivering just thinking about it.
Are humans such evil creatures?]
Start -->1766314315989835[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Winter, always make people feel very lonely it ......
It's all sobering, and even the trees are bare.
No wonder sea otters chose to hibernate in the past, such loneliness can be very difficult to endure.]
Start -->1766314315989837[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Oh! It's you ......
I was just missing you, and the next thing I know, you're in front of me talking to me.
Could it be that Seabert has wizard blood? Haha, just kidding.]
Start -->1766314315990863[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My friend, the year is coming to an end, I wonder if you have left any regrets this year?
If you have any regrets, don't be too anxious, after all, spring will always come!
You have many chances to make up for your regrets, don't you?]
Start -->1766314315990865[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Hi there! What a beautiful day!
Out for a walk, huh?]
Start -->1766314315991891[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

While the heat is on, I'm going to help my uncle prepare some dried fish for his drinks
He always yells that baked dried fish and air-dried dried fish have completely different flavors.
You'll get tired of eating one kind all the time!]
Start -->1766408982327040[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Hello again!
You're looking very energetic today.
Let's welcome the new day with vigor!]
Start -->1766314315991895[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Whew ...... It's a little chilly today!
Move around, it will warm you up.
Don't stay outside for a long time, you'll catch a cold that way and Seabert doesn't want to see you catch a cold.]
Start -->1766409044326145[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Have you been following the documentary channel in the evening prime time?
Recently, it's been airing topics related to the Great Migration of Grassland Wildlife.
Whisper it, this program is produced by my mom and dad.]
Start -->1766314315992923[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Even in summer, the sea breeze is still cool at night.
Seikyu is really a nice place, so comfortable that you can forget the past.
Everyone is living in such an environment for a change, aren't they?]
Start -->1766314315993949[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I've heard that terrible things happen in Seikyu late at night ......
There's a big spooky yokai that will roam the streets and no one knows where it comes from.
But once it's morning he disappears, so I've never seen it.]
Start -->1766314315993951[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

&#40;Yawn&#41; So sleepy. Once the cold season hits, we sea otters are very drowsy.
To cheer me up, I usually watch the late-night program on TV.
Otherwise, I'll help my uncle mend his fishing nets, and the time will pass quickly.]
Start -->1766408311646975[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's raining again ......
Despite the rain, I feel that the whole world is much quieter than usual yet.
Silence is born from noise, just as new life comes from death.
Oops, let my inner poet slip out again.
Wait, what if I were a poet in a previous life?]
Start -->1766314315994979[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Summer rain is much more cranky than other seasons ......
The rain falls like someone hit me in the head with a small stone, it kind of hurts ouch!
Maybe I should give up the obsession and start using an umbrella too.]
Start -->1766314315994981[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

When it rains, my uncle always feels pain in his knees.
He said it was an old problem from working on the deck when he was young and that it was fine.
I tried to do something for him, but he didn't appreciate it.]
Start -->1766314315996007[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's snowing, and Ritsuryo and I made a date to team up for a snowball fight this year.
Perhaps I should contact my stance on the fly so that I don't hold Ritsuryo back during the official competition.
After all, Ritsuryo seems much more agile than me.]
Start -->1766314374409065[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's the Carp Festival today. Isn't the town bustling with activity?
Don't forget to visit your uncle's stall, there are fun activities!
There are also prizes to be exchanged, so remember to go!]
Start -->1766314374409067[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Have fun!]
Start -->1766314374410093[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Because &lbrace;playername&rbrace; is my most important friend, so no matter what difficulties I encounter, I will face them with you.
Of course, if Seabert is in trouble, he'll find &lbrace;playername&rbrace; first.
You mustn't think I'm too much trouble, right?]
Start -->1766314374410095[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I think I kind of understand the point of the camera's existence.
Every beautiful moment is only regretted when it is slowly forgotten, but often it is too late.
Camera can make this beautiful forever.]
Start -->1766314374411121[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Would &lbrace;playername&rbrace; consider leaving Seikyu in the future to live somewhere else?
Or have you already decided to stay?
However, regardless of that choice, it won't affect our friendship.]
Start -->1766314374412147[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

The Carp Festival is a very important festival in the sea otter's homeland.
I didn't realize Seikyu's festival atmosphere wasn't bad!
Have fun today, and don't go back early, you'll miss a lot of fun.]
Start -->1766314374412149[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Well, precious time should be spent playing, so I'll see you later.]
Start -->1766314374413175[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Bye. Seabert will miss you.]
