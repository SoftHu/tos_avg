Okay, be sure to come and play with me again!]

Hello! The weather is nice today! You must be out for a walk, right?
Taking advantage of the good weather, I need to dry some fish for my uncle's snacks. He always says grilled fish isn't as fragrant as sun-dried.]
Start -->1727379415580767[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Hi there! Do you need anything from Haibao? Although I'm not very good at solving problems, I'm great at cheering you up.
If you have any worries, don't forget to talk to me. Also, going outside to enjoy the scenery can improve your mood.]

My uncle always treats me like a child and doesn't let me help with the shop... Saying, &quot;This isn't something a child should face.&quot;
I want to help him reduce his burden, but he doesn't appreciate it! He always says if something happens to me, he can't explain it to my parents!]
Start -->1727379815240803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

My uncle doesn't let me wander in the wild, saying it's more dangerous than the sea. There are many scary rumors in Seikyu, more exaggerated than comic books!
Staying in town all the time is boring, especially with so many beautiful sceneries in Seikyu. It's a pity not to see them.]

My favorite festival is the Summer Festival. Every year, Musashi prepares a lot of beautiful fireworks.
The fireworks explode in the sky, reflecting on the sea, and are shattered by the waves. I think it's beautiful. I wish I could capture it with a camera!]
Start -->1727379815241833[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Some fierce-looking people often visit my uncle's shop. At first, I thought they were troublemakers and was worried about solving the problem.
But it seems they have no malice and even bring me delicious snacks. People indeed can't be judged by their appearance...]
Start -->1727381607774317[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727381607774319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727381607775345[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727381607775347[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727381607775349[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Are you deliberately trying to humiliate me? You're making me angry now!]
Start -->1727381607776375[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace;... We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727381607776377[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1756935544109107[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

It's raining again... Although the rain is drizzling, the whole world feels much quieter than usual.
Oh no, I inadvertently said something poetic again. Could it be that in my past life, I was a poet?]
Start -->1756935994392630[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Good morning, nice to see you again! You look very energetic today~ Let's face the new day with enthusiasm!]
Start -->1756936273795129[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Did you hear? Musashi plans to bring in a batch of comic books from outside. Finally, Ritsuryo and I can catch up with the updates!]
Start -->1756936756863036[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Have you been following the prime-time documentary channel in the evening? Recently, there will be a broadcast of the great migration of wild animals on the prairie. Let me tell you a secret; this show was produced by my parents.]
Start -->1757998365163076[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Minors are not allowed to drink... I'm here to find Ritsuryo.]

My uncle said that he and my mom have good alcohol tolerance because of family genetics, so my future alcohol tolerance will be good too.]
Start -->1757999058116168[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I love eating the free snacks at the tavern. They're called &quot;Kakinotane peanuts.&quot; They're so delicious that my uncle specially bought some for me to take home.
But when I eat them at home, they seem plain. Could it be that the tavern has an aura that makes snacks taste better?]
Start -->1758159149355629[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Is this the adult world? I can't wait to grow up...]
Start -->1758254907850342[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

I helped with the preparations for this year's Summer Festival! &lbrace;npc.4209.first_name&rbrace; said everyone's joy is partly because of my contribution.]
Start -->1758255297076840[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>

Goodbye, have fun!]
