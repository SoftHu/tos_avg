\nAlrighty, don't be a stranger!]

\nHi there! What a beautiful day!
Out for a walk, huh?\nThis is the perfect weather to make my uncle
some dried fish he can eat while drinking.
He prefers his fish to be sun-dried, not grilled.]
Start -->1727379415580767[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nHiya! Need anything from me?
I'm not the best problem solver, but I'm great at
cheering people up.\nYou got anything on your mind, come chat with me.
Or go out and enjoy the view; it'll cheer you up.]

\nMy uncle always treats me like a child and
never lets me help out at the shop...
He's like, &quot;This isn't kid stuff.&quot;\nI just want to give him a hand,
but he won't let me!
He's always like, &quot;What if something happens to you?&quot;]
Start -->1727379815240803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nMy uncle doesn't let me wander around;
says it's more dangerous than the sea.
He's heard all these rumors, crazier than comic books!\nI'm trapped in town all the time. So boring.
I mean, there's so much to see in Seikyu.
Be a shame if I don't go check it out.]

\nThe Summer Festival is my favorite!
Every year, Musashi puts on a heck of a fireworks show.\nFireworks exploding in the sky, their reflection
on the sea crushed by the waves. Nothing beats that.
I wish I could capture it with a camera!]
Start -->1727379815241833[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nEvery now and then, some tough looking guys
would visit my uncle's shop. At first, I thought
they were troublemakers and got a little worried.\nBut they don't seem to mean any harm,
and even bring me delicious snacks.
It's true you can't judge a book by its cover...]
Start -->1727381607774317[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nOh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727381607774319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nThank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727381607775345[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727381607775347[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nAlthough I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727381607775349[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nYou trying to humiliate me?
Oh I'm furious now!]

\nI'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727381607776377[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace;!]
Start -->1756935544109107[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nIt's raining again...
The rain goes pit-a-pat, but the whole world
feels much quieter than usual.\nOops, let my inner poet slip out again.
Wait, what if I were a poet in a previous life?]
Start -->1756935994392630[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Seabert:</b>
\nGood morning, nice to see you again!
You look energetic today!
Let's get pumped for a new day!]

\nDid you hear? Musashi is bringing in new
comic books from outside. Finally Ritsuryo and I
can catch up with the world!]

\nDo you watch the prime-time documentary channel?
There's a show about animal migration coming up.
Here's a secret - it was produced by my parents.]

\nMy uncle said he and my mom can hold their liquor.
Family genetics.
That means I'll be a heavyweight drinker too.]

\nI just love the free snacks at the tavern.
My favorite is kakinotane. It's so delicious that
my uncle would buy some for me to take home.\nBut when I eat it at home, it's just... meh.
Does the tavern somehow make snacks taste better?]

\nIs this the adult world?
I can't wait to grow up...]

\nI helped out with this year's Summer Festival!
&lbrace;npc.4209.first_name&rbrace; said I contributed
to the fun everybody was having.]

\nGotta go, have fun!]
