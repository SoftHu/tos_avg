Boss &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace; pays better than a tanuki...
Ahem, I mean significantly more than ideal.
If you're interested, drop by the shop and say &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; sent you.]
1754546165802936 -->1754546389367737{ }
1754546389367737 -->|Thank you.|1754548441282496[<b>Speaker 👉 Uozumi:</b>

After all, being a parent myself,
I can't help but look after the young ones.
Don't mind my ramblings.
My grandmother always told me
that kindness to others leads to help when you need it most.]
1754546389367737 -->|I'll ask about it when I have a chance.|1754548441282496[<b>Speaker 👉 Uozumi:</b>

1754549631671233 -->|I feel the same way.|1754550460743622[<b>Speaker 👉 Uozumi:</b>

You're wise beyond your years;
it seems you've had a tough life.]
1754549631671233 -->|Life isn't always fair.|1754550466679751[<b>Speaker 👉 Uozumi:</b>

Young and already so pessimistic,
it looks like you've been through a lot.]

But don't worry, Seikyu is a great place.
Once here, things will go smoothly,
that's my experience anyway!
And hey, stay away from the underground ruins...]

1754552329160649 -->|Why?|1754552698678222[<b>Speaker 👉 Uozumi:</b>

I'm just a little pelican, how could I possibly know anything?!
It's just... just a feeling – a sixth sense, you know?
Anyway, just listen to Uncle and stay away from there, okay?!
By the way, here's a fish I caught today.
Add it to your meal.
All right, Uncle's got to get back to work. See you!]
