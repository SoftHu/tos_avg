\nSo it was you who defeated Angie?
Would you look at that, a young fox.\nYou must be a misfit...
You turned into human by accident and now
you don't know how to go back being a fox.]

\nBecause only foxes and tanuki are capable of
transforming into other yokai.\nWithout the guidance of a blood relative,

After all, we have the same origin story.]
