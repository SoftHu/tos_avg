Hello, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
I am Yui Oda, the Mayor of Seikyu. 
Welcome to our little town. 
I hope you enjoy your new life here! ]
1741755494745335 -->1741756528441605[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Is this a friend of yours?]
1741756528441605 -->1741757031856437{ }
1741757031856437 -->|She's my little sister.|1741757163471162[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

I know we look a little different
I havenâ€™t mastered transformation yetâ€¦
But we managed to save money to settle in Seikyu by working so hard.]
1741757031856437 -->|She's more of a pet.|1741756575679750[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

I AM NOT A PET!!!
I'm &lbrace;playername&rbrace;'s sister, Kon. 
I just haven't mastered transformation yetâ€¦
Without me we wouldn't have been able to save enough money
to move to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;.]
1741757163471162 -->1741757234370875[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; is lucky to have such a determined sister. 
And transformation is tricky. It will come in timeâ€¦]
1741757234370875 -->1768723299440528[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

That reminds meâ€¦
As you know, Seikyu was founded by foxes.
We've done our very best to preserve their commitment to harmony. 
My father was close with the foxes before they disappeared. 
He was the mayor before me and strove to keep Seikyu peaceful. 
Saying that... the fox shrines could use some restoration.
Anyway!
Let me show you the rest of the town!  ]

I'm sure &lbrace;playername&rbrace; was just making a little joke, sweetie.
That reminds me, 
&lbrace;location.13&rbrace; was once a sanctuary protected by foxes.]
