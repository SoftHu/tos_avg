\nHello! A new face!
Those very rarely greet our shores.
\nAre you &lbrace;playername&rbrace;, 
the fox yokai we were foretold of?]
1741755494745335 -->|Yes, that's me!|1772249115197577[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nYour ancestors are very talkative.
They told us all about you and your sister's arrival.

\nYes, of course! It's lovely to meet you finally, Kon.\nYou knowâ€¦ Seikyu was actually founded by the Fox Clan. 
So, we've done our best to preserve your clan's commitment to harmony.
\nIf you want to hear more from your ancestors, 
I suggest you start by restoring the shrine on the outskirts of town. \nWe tried restoring it ourselves, but our connection with them has faded over timeâ€¦ 
I hope you can fix thatâ€¦\nAnyway, enough about that!
Do you want me to show you around town?
