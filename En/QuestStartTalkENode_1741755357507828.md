Hello, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
I am Yui Oda, the Mayor of Seikyu. 
Welcome to our little town. 
I hope you enjoy your new life here! ]
1741755494745335 -->1741756528441605[<b>Speaker 👉 Yui:</b>

Is this a friend of yours?]

1741757031856437 -->|She's my little sister.|1741757163471162[<b>Speaker 👉 Kon:</b>

I know we look a little different
I haven’t mastered transformation yet…
But we managed to save enough money to settle in Seikyu by working our butts off.]
1741757031856437 -->|She's more of a pet.|1741756575679750[<b>Speaker 👉 Kon:</b>

I AM NOT A PET!!!
I'm &lbrace;playername&rbrace;'s sister, Kon. 
I just haven’t mastered transformation yet…

We managed to save enough money to settle in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; by working our butts off.]
1741757163471162 -->1741757234370875[<b>Speaker 👉 Yui:</b>

&lbrace;player name&rbrace; is lucky to have such a determined sister. 
And transformation is tricky. It will come in time…]

That reminds me…
As you know, Seikyu was founded by the Fox clan.
We’ve done our very best to preserve the your clan’s commitment to harmony. 
My father was good friends with the foxes before they disappeared. 
He was the mayor before me and strove to keep Seikyu peaceful and happy. 
  ...but some fox shrines might need a little cleaning.
  Anyway!
  Let me show you the rest of the town!  ]

I'm sure you're just making a little joke, sweetie.
That reminds me, &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; was once a sanctuary
protected by foxes.]
