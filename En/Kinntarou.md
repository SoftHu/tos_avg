\nGot anything tasty to share with me?
I'm getting tired of these snacks!]

\nThe comic book mentions a distant country in the East,
where delicious dishes are plentiful.
Xiaolongbao, hot pot, tanghulu, and spring rolls...\nJust thinking about them makes my mouth water!
I've got to see for myself someday...]
Start -->1740395659485401[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nI always feel like Ritsuryo's up to something...
Maybe like those dungeon adventures in comic books?
Or perhaps he found a tasty snack and hasn't told me?]
Start -->1740401072152795[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nOh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1740401072153821[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nThank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1740401072153823[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1740401072153825[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nAlthough I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1740401072154851[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nAre you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1740401072154853[<b>Speaker 👉 player:</b>
\nI'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1740401072154855[<b>Speaker 👉 player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace;!]
Start -->1740401882859753[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nWell, see ya!
Bring some tasty snacks with you next time!]

\nMom says the Carp Festival is a festival for boys.
She hopes &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace; and I grow up nice and healthy.
I'm more interested in the festival snacks though.]
Start -->1753043602719533[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nHappy Carp Festival!
Time to go grab a bite.]

\nMe and Ritsuryo know Shuten isn't our real mom.
She never asks us to call her mom, either.
But what else should we call her?]

\nYou know what the greatest job is?
A chef!
Surprising, but it's the truth.]

\nUgh...
I'm so sleepy from staying up watching TV last night.
I'll take a nap after lunch.]

\nMusashi once invited me to his house for afternoon tea.
The tea was... well, tea.
But the wagashi was so good!]
Start -->1757547553408543[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nIt's getting busy again...
Let's get ready and stay sharp.]
Start -->1757547891338785[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nIt's such a beautiful day out,
no wonder Ritsuryo disappeared early in the morning.
Must have sneaked out to play again.]
Start -->1757548035372579[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nI'm so bored...
I just wanna stay home and sleep on a day like this.
You feel the same way, right?]
Start -->1757731991162451[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nHave a seat!
Get yourself something to drink...\nCome find me if you're hungry.
I know people come here to drink,
but you don't wanna starve, right?]

\nI'm a kid but I live like an office worker already...
People will be amazed at my work experience
when I apply for jobs in the future...]
Start -->1758010932068960[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nI'm getting used to being a night owl even though
it's not the healthiest lifestyle for a kid.
At my age, I should be in bed by nine!]

\nMinors aren't allowed to play these games...
Don't worry, I'm just here to look for tasty treats.]
Start -->1758088092584535[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>
\nI have no idea why they let me in though...
But since I'm here,
I might as well look around!]

\nThey've got delicious takoyaki today...
Do you know what makes takoyaki so tasty?
I'll let you in on a secret - it's the bonito flakes.]
