Got anything tasty to share with me?
I'm getting tired of these snacks!]
Start -->1740394561721559[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

The comic book mentions a distant country in the East,
where delicious dishes are plentiful.
Xiaolongbao, hot pot, tanghulu, and spring rolls...
Just thinking about them makes my mouth water!
I've got to see for myself someday...]
Start -->1740395659485401[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I always feel like Ritsuryo's up to something...
Maybe like those dungeon adventures in comic books?
Or perhaps he found a tasty snack and hasn't told me?]
Start -->1740401072152795[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1740401072153821[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1740401072153823[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1740401072153825[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1740401072154851[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1740401072154853[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1740401072154855[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace;!]
Start -->1740401882859753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Well, see ya!
Bring some tasty snacks with you next time!]
Start -->1753043153997612[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Mom says the Carp Festival is a festival for boys.
She hopes &lbrace;npc.4102&rbrace; and I grow up nice and healthy.
I'm more interested in the festival snacks though.]
Start -->1753043602719533[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Happy Carp Festival!
Time to go grab a bite.]
Start -->1757546431502871[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Me and Ritsuryo know Shuten isn't our real mom.
She never asks us to call her mom, either.
But what else should we call her?]
Start -->1757546569728537[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

You know what the greatest job is?
A chef!
Surprising, but it's the truth.]
Start -->1757547255693851[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Ugh...
I'm so sleepy from staying up watching TV last night.
I'll take a nap after lunch.]

Musashi once invited me to his house for afternoon tea.
The tea was... well, tea.
But the wagashi was so good!]
Start -->1757547553408543[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

It's getting busy again...
Let's get ready and stay sharp.]
Start -->1757547891338785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

It's such a beautiful day out,
no wonder Ritsuryo disappeared early in the morning.
Must have sneaked out to play again.]
Start -->1757548035372579[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I'm so bored...
I just wanna stay home and sleep on a day like this.
You feel the same way, right?]
Start -->1757731991162451[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Have a seat!
Get yourself something to drink...
Come find me if you're hungry.
I know people come here to drink,
but you don't wanna starve, right?]
Start -->1758010836575838[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I'm a kid but I live like an office worker already...
People will be amazed at my work experience
when I apply for jobs in the future...]
Start -->1758010932068960[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I'm getting used to being a night owl even though
it's not the healthiest lifestyle for a kid.
At my age, I should be in bed by nine!]
Start -->1758084967348788[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Minors aren't allowed to play these games...
Don't worry, I'm just here to look for tasty treats.]
Start -->1758088092584535[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I have no idea why they let me in though...
But since I'm here,
I might as well look around!]
Start -->1758176305005128[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

They've got delicious takoyaki today...
Do you know what makes takoyaki so tasty?
I'll let you in on a secret - it's the bonito flakes.]
Start -->1758177250843210[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Catch you later!
Have fun...]
