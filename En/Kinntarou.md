The comic book mentions a distant country in the East. It's famous for various delicacies like xiaolongbao, spicy hot pot, candied haws, and spring rolls...]

Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! I have to see it for myself someday...
I always feel Ritsuryo's up to something... Maybe like those dungeon adventures in comic books? Or perhaps he's found some delicious food and hasn't told me?]
Start -->1740395659485401[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace;... We're getting along well!]
Start -->1740401072152795[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1740401072153821[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1740401072153823[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1740401072153825[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1740401072154851[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1740401072154853[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4103&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1740401072154855[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Alright, goodbye! Remember to share some tasty food with me next time!]

Mum says the Carp Festival is for boys to grow healthy. I'm more interested in the festival snacks though.]
Start -->1753043153997612[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Happy Carp Festival! I should go and find something to eat too.]

Although Ritsuryo and I know that Shuten is not our real mom, she never asks us to call her mom. But what else should we call her?]

Do you know what the greatest profession in the world is? It's being a chef! This answer might shock you, but it's the truth.]
Start -->1757546569728537[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Ah... I'm so sleepy, I stayed up too late watching TV last night. I'll take a nap after lunch.]

Brother Musashi once invited me to his house for afternoon tea. The tea was nothing special, but the wagashi was delicious!]
Start -->1757547400011293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

It's the busiest time again... Let's get ready and stay energized.]
Start -->1757547553408543[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

The weather is really nice today, no wonder Ritsuryo disappeared early in the morning. He must have sneaked out to play again.]
Start -->1757547891338785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I'm so bored... In this weather, I just want to stay home and sleep. You feel the same way, right?]
Start -->1757548035372579[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Have a seat! Get yourself something to drink first...]
Start -->1757731991162451[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

If you're hungry, just come to me. Although everyone comes here to drink, you can't be hungry, right?
So young and already living the life of an office worker... When I apply for jobs in the future, people will be amazed by my work experience...]
Start -->1758010836575838[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I should get used to this reversed day and night routine... Although nightlife is not healthy for kids, someone my age should be in bed by nine!]
Start -->1758010932068960[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

Minors are not allowed to play these games... Don't worry, I'm just here to see if there's any good food.]
Start -->1758084967348788[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

I don't know why they let me in... But since I'm here, I might as well look around!]
Start -->1758088092584535[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

There are delicious takoyaki today... Do you know the soul of takoyaki? I'll tell you secretly, it's the bonito flakes.]
Start -->1758176305005128[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kinntarou:</b>

See you later! Have fun...]
