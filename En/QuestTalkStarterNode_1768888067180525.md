&lbrace;playername&rbrace;! 
Have you noticed how kind everyone in Seikyu is? 
Itâ€™s such a wonderful place.
I think we should share around some of that kindness too. ]

Oh, please. 
Besides, if you're thinking of giving someone away, 
it should be you.
At least you'd make quite the conversation piece!]

Ummmm...how about we cook something delicious 
and bring it to one of the yokai in town? 
Theyâ€™ll appreciate the gesture, 
Iâ€™m sure! ]
1768888249640951 -->1768888572405757[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

First, we need to build a stove. 
And thenâ€¦ 
Well, 
nothing says 'kindnessâ€™ like perfectly cooked Char-Grilled Kebabs, 
right?]
