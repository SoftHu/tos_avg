&lbrace;playername&rbrace;! 
Have you noticed how friendly everyone in Seikyu is? 
Itâ€™s such a wonderful place to be, 
and I think we should share that kindness. ]

Oh, please. 
Besides, if youâ€™re thinking of giving anyone away, 
You should be the one in a box.
At least you'd make an interesting conversation piece!]

Ummmm...how about we cook something delicious 
and bring it to one of the yokai in town? 
Theyâ€™ll appreciate the gesture, 
Iâ€™m sure! ]
1768888249640951 -->1768888572405757[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Exactly!
Now, letâ€™s focus on making something they actually want
â€”and thatâ€™s not you or me.]

First, we need to build a stove. 
And thenâ€¦ 
well, 
nothing says â€˜kindnessâ€™ like a perfectly cooked Char-Grilled Kebab, 
right?]
