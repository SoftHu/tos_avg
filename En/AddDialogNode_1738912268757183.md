\nOf course, I can tell you lots about this place
and give you some tips for living here.\nThere's an ancient legend of this place...
about a great war between foxes and Tanuki.
The Tanuki once drove the foxes away, taking over this land.\nBut one day, a nine-tailed fox stood up,
protected the other foxes and defended their last 
sanctuary.\nIn the land of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;, you will find many fox shrines.
These shrines were built to commemorate
that brave nine-tailed fox.\nIf you wish, you can help look after these shrines 
and in kind, the spirits may look after you.]
