Wow, what a stroke of luck!
Look, top-quality iron ore!
Master Muramasa once told me
that Seikyu's iron ore contains a lot of carbon,
making it perfect for crafting blades.]
1750843311597832 -->1750843489202441{ }
1750843489202441 -->|Master Muramasa?|1750843511057678[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Master Muramasa is a renowned bladesmith and the teacher
who taught me how to select and forge materials.
I spent my entire youth under his guidance.]
1750843489202441 -->|Sounds familiar...|1750843511057678[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Start -->1750844326438180[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

He means much more to me than just that.
Even though I haven't been under his tutelage for many years,
He still crosses my mind from time to time.]
1750844326438180 -->1750843531953423{ }
1750843531953423 -->|It seems he was very important to you.|1750843556242708[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Yes, when I used to go out mining,
it was Master Muramasa who taught me how to identify ores,
so it feels a bit lonely mining here in Seikyu without him.]
1750843531953423 -->|You miss the old days.|1750843556242708[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Yes, when I used to go out mining,

1750843610641685 -->|If you feel lonely...|1750843645790490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Thank you for your comfort.
I will always keep my master in my heart.]
1750843610641685 -->|I can go to the mines with you.|1750843651490075[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Really? Then it's a date!
Whenever you want to mine,
you can count on me to join you. I'll be waiting.]

The feeling of sweating is so exhilarating...
I have faith more and more residents will think so and join us too.
Blacksmithing takes a long time and lots of physical effort.
In our community, the size of your muscles dictates the size 
of the items you can forge!]
1751366028817745 -->1751366238300522[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

So Mr Muscular Blacksmith,
when are you going to forge a 'Muramasa's inscription' for me?]
1751366238300522 -->1751366272377195[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Hey brother, haven't you retired from the warrior life? 
A 'Muramasa's inscription' is no longer of any use to you, no?]
1751366272377195 -->1751366336661868{ }
1751366336661868 -->|Muramasa's inscription?|1751366551144817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

This is the treasure every warrior dreams of,
and the craftsman in front of you is the rightful heir,
even though he always rejects my requests.]
1751366336661868 -->|What's this...?|1751366551144817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

This is the treasure every warrior dreams of,
and the craftsman in front of you is the rightful heir,
even though he always rejects my requests.]
1751366551144817 -->1751366797251954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

For ordinary people, a 'Muramasa's inscription' would spell disaster.
We've been friends for many years and I don't suffer, Torleone.]
1751366797251954 -->1751366826677619[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

All right, all right, it's always like this. You always think that
I'm not worthy, don't you?]
1751366826677619 -->1751366849399156[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Torleone... that's not what I meant...]
1751366849399156 -->1751367042076021[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

But you've always thought that!]

Start -->1751367195766136[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Sorry, today was supposed to be a happy day
but I seem to have ruined it...]

1751367217642873 -->|What kind of friends don't argue...?|1751367543267712[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I'll have a good chat with him about this,
of course,
but I'll wait until he's in a better mood.
Don't forget to rehydrate.
Let's train together again next time!]
1751367217642873 -->|You ignored his feelings...|1751367543267712[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
