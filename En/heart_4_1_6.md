\nHo, feels good to sweat eh, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;?

1750844326438180 -->|You miss the old days.|1750843556242708[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYes, when I used to go out mining,
it was Master Muramasa who taught me how to identify ores.

1751366028817745 -->1751366238300522[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

1751366238300522 -->1751366272377195[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI thought your fighting days were over, Tor.

\nIt is a treasure that all warriors dream of!
&lbrace;npc.4106&rbrace; carries knowledge from Master Muramasa himself.
A magic inscription that grants a weapon unmatched power!\nThose who wield a Muramasa blade are nearly unstoppable. 
But &lbrace;npc.4106&rbrace; refuses to make one for me!]

1751366551144817 -->1751366797251954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nA Muramasa blade is extremely dangerous!
An ordinary swordsman would be consumed by it. 
After many years of friendship, I wouldn't put that misfortune on you.]
1751366797251954 -->1751366826677619[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>

1751367195766136 -->|You should just make him the weapon.|1751367543267712[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nThe Muramasa inscription is not something to be taken lightly. 
Its power should only fall to one truly deserving.
I hope to find a worthy swordsman one day.\nI'll talk to Tor when he's cooled off.\nNow! Don't forget to hydrate after sweating so much. 
Let's try to keep our new club alive, eh?]
