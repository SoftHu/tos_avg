Bye.]
Start -->1727647127117917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Hello, hello... what's the matter?]
Start -->1727647155424351[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'll let you in on a secret: I was smuggled in originallyâ€¦
I had no choice...
There was no other way.
Only thanks to Boss Torleone's care,
was I able to settle hereâ€¦]
Start -->1727647155424353[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The town might seem calm on the surface,
but it's only thanks to the big shots keeping things in order.
If you pay close attention,
you'll notice some dubious strangers in town now and then.
Be wary of them... They are trouble.]
Start -->1727647236932707[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727647236932709[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727647236932711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727647236933737[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727647236933739[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727647236933741[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4213&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727647236933743[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4213&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753055474016069[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Today is a day for celebration,
but I just can't seem to get into the festive spirit.
Thinking about my son back home makes me feel a bit sad.]
Start -->1753055480212294[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's a rare festival day, have fun!]
Start -->1758257068134002[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

If you have something to say spit it out! I want to take part in the event!]
Start -->1758257158766196[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm not telling you...]
Start -->1763832027155191[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

You ...... should not be interested in me, right?
I'm the one who has a fiancÃ©e.]
Start -->1763832027155193[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

I didn't realize that someone like me, who doesn't have much of a presence
Can also receive such a good gift ......]
Start -->1763832027156219[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;
A small gift, a big surprise.]
Start -->1763832027156221[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

How is this a good idea? ......
I can't just take your gift.]
Start -->1763832027157247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

That's disturbing. Maybe you're looking for the town's trash cans?
Either way, shouldn't be shoving trash in my hand ......]
Start -->1763832027157249[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Ryoko used to be the only one who would remember my birthday ......
Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;
So heartwarming!]
Start -->1763832027157251[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Coming to Seikyu, you are my first friend.
Thank you for remembering my birthday and giving me such a nice gift.]
Start -->1763832027158277[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

The happiest thing about birthdays is that you get to receive a birthday present!]
Start -->1763832027158279[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

It's the thought that counts, and I'm grateful to be thought of by a friend like you.]
Start -->1763832027159305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

...... You people, hi ya!
What's wrong with you?]
Start -->1763832027159307[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Goodbye ......]
Start -->1763832027159309[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Well, it looks like you're busy too, so let's talk about it.]
Start -->1763832027160335[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Theo:</b>

Bye-bye!]
