\nThis temple is dedicated to Inari,
The goddess of transformation
and harvest but everyone forgets that part.\nInari is the Fox Clanâ€™s patron and they her chosen children,
Or so the legends sayâ€¦
But your transformation ability would certainly suggest so...\nIâ€™ve known scores of great foxes in my time.
But thenâ€¦ Poofâ€¦ 
They all disappeared years ago.]

\nWhere did they go?]
1774711928965451 -->1774711959005517[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nI havenâ€™t the foggiest! 
but likely has to do with the Tanuki.]
1774711959005517 -->|We know about the Tanuki.|1774711996014934[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nTanuki are tricksy but good for a practical joke.
They really arenâ€™t so bad, except for all the warâ€¦\nThey always coveted the foxâ€™s power, but your clans are quite similar actually.]
1774711959005517 -->|Tanuki and Foxes donâ€™t get along.|1774711996014934[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>

\nAhaâ€¦ 
You know who might help you?
The Goddess Inari.\nThere is an ancient scroll, Tales of Glory,
which contains the history of all Yokai,
Foxes included.\nThis scroll is the number 2 bestseller,
behind my autobiography, of course!
It will quench many of your queries.\nThere is a section of this scroll sealed in this altar.
Perhaps you can open the seal and get the fragment.
Why donâ€™t you make an offering to Inari and see?]
