Take me out to play once in a while too!]
Start -->1727655446019261[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning! Such a wonderful morning shouldn't be missed. Time to get to work, there's a lot to do.]
Start -->1727655446019263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning, did you sleep well last night?]
Start -->1727655446020291[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning. Do we have any plans today?]
Start -->1727655446020293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Anything up?]
Start -->1727655446021319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

A busy day begins! Stay energized!]
Start -->1727655446021325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good evening!]
Start -->1727655446022353[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

It's already this late? Rest early, don't overwork yourself. The fox spirit said worrying too much and staying up late will turn you into an ugly puppy...]
Start -->1727655446024413[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning, let's keep our spirits up today too!]
Start -->1727656221585637[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Speaking of which, are you getting used to transforming? Do you ever feel like these powers aren't yours when you use them?
Maybe, over time, the transformation will replace your personality... Haha, you look so serious! Just kidding, that can't happen.]
Start -->1727656221585635[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The ranch still retains its old design... like no separate Western-style kitchen. Everyone has to gather around the fire at mealtimes.
Although eating by the warm fire is a happy thing, the thought of the lingering smell of smoke in the fur is quite a headache.]
Start -->1727656221586665[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You seem to have a special power to unite everyone... 
I'm finally starting to understand why the Fox Spirit chose you.]
Start -->1727657111555307[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727657111555309[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727657111555311[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727657111556337[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727657111556339[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727657111556341[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727657111557367[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1740296790321370[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

All right, we'll talk later.]
Start -->1740402571945195[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Seikyu's breeze feels so comforting...
I miss my mumâ€¦
She used to comb my hair just like this, so gently.
Oh, I wonder where mom and dad are now... But don't worry, Kitsuho will always be with you. Let's create more memories together!]
Start -->1740402571945197[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

This place is really livable! There's so much space, and the neighbors are so friendly... I love it here!]
Start -->1753044301893424[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The town looks beautiful today, with the colorful Carp Festival flags flying. Should we hang some in &lbrace;location.1&rbrace; as well?]
Start -->1753045038214962[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You can participate in the Carp Flag capturing event at the Carp Festival! Take me with you! Take me with you!]
Start -->1757025764614264[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The fox spirits say that afternoon is the best time for practice. Oh, I've been working so hard, but I still feel so sleepy...]
Start -->1727656221586663[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

I also want to learn the art of transformation... The fox spirits said they'll teach me once I grow a bit older.
But right now, I can't even transform into a human form! Ahhh! It's so frustrating...]
Start -->1757028043846787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The weather is so nice today, you should take me out to play! Right? Right? You can't just leave me at home all the time! I'm not your pet...]
Start -->1757028156646534[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

I hate rainy days the most! Every time it rains, it reminds me of the days when I was wandering, with my fur all wet and shivering from the cold.]
Start -->1757734086215253[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Although the fox spirits allow you to relax in the tavern occasionally, they didn't say you could get drunk! I'll be keeping an eye on you...]
Start -->1758012357671524[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You reek of alcohol... Get away from me, don't talk to me!]
Start -->1758088248306265[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Yay! The queen of the casino, Kitsuho, has arrived... Tonight's winner will be none other than me!]
Start -->1758088544254555[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Having fun is important, but you should know your limits!
If you lose next month's living expenses, we'll have to eat grass...]
Start -->1758178075629133[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

In the past, we could only watch from the sidelines. Now that Aoba is our home, we finally feel like we belong.]
Start -->1758178172890703[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Alright, no more chatting. Precious time should be spent having fun!]
