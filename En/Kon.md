Come on, take me with you once in a while!]
Start -->1727655446019261[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning!
Can't let such a wonderful morning go to waste.
Time to get to work, there's a lot to do.]
Start -->1727655446019263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Morning, did you sleep well last night?]
Start -->1727655446020291[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning. Any plans for today?]
Start -->1727655446020293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Anything I can help you with?]
Start -->1727655446021319[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

A busy day begins! Stay energized!]
Start -->1727655446021325[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good evening!]
Start -->1727655446022353[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Already this late? Go to bed; don't overwork.
The Fox Spirit warned: worrying too much and
staying up late will turn you into an ugly puppy...]
Start -->1727655446024413[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Good morning, let's keep our spirits up today too!]
Start -->1727656221585637[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You should be used to transforming by now, right?
Do you ever feel your self-awareness weakens
when you use powers that don't belong to you?
Perhaps your personality will be changed over time...
Haha, look at your face, so serious!
Just kidding, that can't happen.]
Start -->1727656221585635[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The farmhouse still has its old design...
No separate Western-style kitchen.
Everyone has to gather around the fire to eat.
While eating by the fire makes me happy,
the lingering smell of smoke in my fur gives me
quite a headache.]
Start -->1727656221586665[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You seem to have a special power to unite everyone... 
I'm starting to see why the Fox Spirit chose you.]
Start -->1727657111555307[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727657111555309[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727657111555311[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727657111556337[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727657111556339[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727657111556341[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727657111557367[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1740296790321370[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

All right, we'll talk later.]
Start -->1740402571945195[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Such a nice Seikyu breeze...
I miss Momâ€¦
She used to comb my hair just like this, so gently.
I wonder where Mom and Dad are right now...
But don't worry, I'll always be with you.
Let's make more memories together!]
Start -->1740402571945197[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

This place makes a great home!
So much space, and the neighbors are so friendly...
I love it here!]
Start -->1753044301893424[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The town looks gorgeous today with the colorful
Carp Festival flags flying.
Should we hang some in the &lbrace;location.1&rbrace; as well?]
Start -->1753045038214962[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You can play Flag Capture at the Carp Festival!
Take me with you! Take me with you!]
Start -->1757025764614264[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

According to the Fox Spirits, the afternoon is the
best time for training.
I've been trying so hard but I still feel so sleepy...]
Start -->1727656221586663[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

I'm eager to learn transformation spells...
The Fox Spirits said they'll teach me when I'm older.
But I can't even transform into a human now!
Aargh!
It's so frustrating...]
Start -->1757028043846787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

It's such a beautiful day. Take me out to play!
Pretty please? You can't just leave me at home!
I'm not your pet, you know...]
Start -->1757028156646534[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Ugh... rainy days are the worst!
Every time it rains, it reminds me of the old days.
A homeless wanderer, soaking wet, shivering in the cold.]
Start -->1757734086215253[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

The Fox Spirits allowed you to unwind in the tavern,
but they didn't say you could get drunk!
I'll be keeping an eye on you...]
Start -->1758012357671524[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

You reek of alcohol...
Get away from me and don't talk to me!]
Start -->1758088248306265[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Boom! The Casino Queen is in the house...
Tonight I'm gonna win it all!]
Start -->1758088544254555[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Having some fun is important, but not too much fun!
If you lose next month's living expenses,
we'll be on a full-grass diet...]
Start -->1758178075629133[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

In the past, we could only watch from the sidelines.
Now with Seikyu being our home,
it finally feels like we're part of something.]
Start -->1758178172890703[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

Enough chit-chat.
Precious time should be spent having fun!]
