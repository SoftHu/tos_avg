Well, well. 
It's nice to make your acquaintance too.
That's no way to greet a fellow resident.]

1738369487068285 -->|Sorry, I thought you were a cat.|1738369514544259[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

You must be the new resident of Seikyu.
I'm Musashi.
I run the general store in town. 
If you need anything, just let me know.
I'm sure you'll want a few things for the old farmhouse. 
I can also buy anything you make here.
Just leave what you want to sell in this box.
And I'll come collect it in the mornings.. 
If you've got it, I can sell it! Can't have you running out of money.


But you look like you know how to hustle some coins togetherâ€¦]
