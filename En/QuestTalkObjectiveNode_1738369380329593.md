\nWell, well. 
It's nice to make your acquaintance too.\nThat's no way to greet a fellow resident.]
1738369447807100 -->|Sorry, I thought you were a cat.|1738369514544259[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nThis place is full of surprises.
Things are rarely as they seem.]
1738369447807100 -->|Ohâ€¦|1738369637289097[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nWhat, cat got your tongue?]
1738369514544259 -->1742696668586266[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nYou must be the new resident of Seikyu.
I'm Musashi.\nI run the general store in town. 
If you need anything, just let me know.\nI'm sure you'll want a few things for the old farmhouse. 
I can also buy anything you make here.\nJust leave what you want to sell in this box.
And I'll come collect it in the mornings.. 
If you've got it, I can sell it! Can't have you running out of money.

\nBut you look like you know how to hustle some coins togetherâ€¦]
1742696668586266 -->|Our hustling days are over.|1738369892088971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

So, what are your names?]
1742696668586266 -->|Yep, we worked hard to afford this place.|1738369892088971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nI know the feeling.
