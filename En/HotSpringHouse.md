Uh, sorry to trouble you for a moment. 
Dear guest, according to our records, you have sneaked into the hot spring &lbrace;Property.SneakIntoHotSpringTimes&rbrace; times in the past. 
Such behavior causes a lot of trouble for our business.
According to Seikyu's operating regulations, I must penalize you for sneaking in. 
This time, I will deduct twice the amount of the previous unpaid entries as punishment... 
I hope you learn your lesson, and this will not happen again.]

I believe this punishment will leave a lasting impression,
