Gulu... bye.]
Start -->1727651542984871[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Gulu... gaga?]
Start -->1727651579059369[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Gulu... What's that look on your face?
What, you think I can't talk?
&quot;Gulu&quot;, that's my catchphrase!
Pretty adorable, don't ya think?
All them anime girls have a catchphrase...
I had a bunch of options!
&quot;Gulu&quot;, &quot;Wa&quot;, &quot;Waya&quot;...
But &quot;Gulu&quot; fits my personality best.]
Start -->1727651920367787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

You live with your younger sister I heard?
Must be tough taking care of a kid, huh?
I've been there.
Those little rascals of mine, you take your eyes
off them for a second, they'll raise hell.
But those rug rats make me so happy.]
Start -->1727652971634861[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727652971635887[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727652971635889[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727652971635891[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727652971636917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727652971636919[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727652971636921[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753122343484820[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Every time I see these Carp Festival flags, my inner
fisherman gets jealous.
Will I ever catch a fish as big as them flags?]
Start -->1753122561900949[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Don't forget to see Torleone about participating
in the festival activities.
It'll bring you good luck!]
Start -->1757106924087495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

The residents of Seikyu are so honest and kind.
Reminds me of the old days back home in Shikoku.
Back then, the tanuki hadn't started the war yet,
and everyone lived freely...]
Start -->1757107061923018[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Do you like dried fish?
Sorry, it's just really important for me to know.
Because in my opinion, people who enjoy
dried fish can't be bad, right?]
Start -->1757107193686221[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Every time I see Seabert, I think of my kids at home.
I'm the breadwinner so I can't always be with them.
I have no choice but leave them in their mother's care.
It breaks my heart just thinking about it...
Seabert must miss his parents too.]
Start -->1757107383916752[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Fishing is a serious business...
How you fish affects what you catch.
For example, the extremely rare Golden Arowana
only appears early in the morning.]
Start -->1757107586529491[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Mr. Torleone takes good care of us.
Recently, he asked if I'd like my family to move here.
Truth be told, I've been thinking about it too.]
Start -->1757107589100758[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Fishing is a serious business...
How you fish affects what you catch.
For instance, the extremely precious King Crab
only appears at night.]
Start -->1757107878625497[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

I know them land dwellers love sunny days,
but us fishermen, not so much.
You'll get sunburned. Badly.]
Start -->1757107997909212[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

The Oarfish only appears on rainy days in autumn.
Catching one would make you one lucky fisherman.]
Start -->1758008782489174[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Typically, I'm not one for indulgences,
but Mr. Torleone did say,
&quot;You gotta unwind occasionally. It's my treat.&quot;
And that's why I'm here...]
Start -->1758009218246232[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

My wife loves to drink.
I may not know much about wines and spirits,
but I'm sure she would love the drinks here.
Once she moves to Seikyu,
I'll bring her over for a drink.]
Start -->1758010196168282[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Booze... I gotta have more!
Miss Shuten, another round, please...]
Start -->1758166563155577[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

I heard there are free snacks here, so I came over.
I don't have spare money for gambling...]
Start -->1758166810318459[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Everyone dreams of getting rich overnight,
but I'd rather stay grounded than get swept
away dreaming of wealth.]
Start -->1758257619504762[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Back in Shikoku, we didn't have bustling
festivals like this...
I wish my little ones were here to see it.]
Start -->1758257693513340[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Enjoy all the fun and games on this summer night.
Goodbye...]
