Gulu... bye.]
Start -->1727651542984871[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Gulu... gaga?]
Start -->1727651579059369[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Gulu... What's with that look? Do you think I can't talk?
'Gulu' is just a verbal tic! Don't you think it's cute? All the anime girls say it...
I had other options too! 'Gulu', 'Wa', 'Waya'... But 'Gulu' fits my character best.]

I heard you live with your sister. Taking care of a child must be tough, right? I have quite a bit of experience too.
My little rascals at home, if you take your eyes off them for a moment, they'll cause trouble. Kids can be mischievous, but they always bring joy to the heart.]
Start -->1727652971634861[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727652971635887[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727652971635889[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727652971635891[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727652971636917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727652971636919[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727652971636921[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753122343484820[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Seeing these Carp Festival flags fluttering in the wind give me an occupational headache.
When will I ever catch a fish as big as a Carp Festival flag?]
Start -->1753122561900949[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Don't forget to see Torleone about participating
in the festival activities.
It's a way to pray for good fortune!]

The residents of Aoba Town are so simple and kind. It reminds me of my old days back home in Shikoku.
Back then, the tanuki hadn't started their war yet, and everyone lived freely...]
Start -->1757107061923018[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Do you like eating dried fish? Sorry, I just really care about this question.
Because in my opinion, people who like eating dried fish can't be bad, right?]
Start -->1757107193686221[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Every time I see Haibao, I can't help but think of my little ones at home. As a father, I can't always be there to watch them grow because I'm working to support the family. I have to leave them in their mother's care.
It breaks my heart just thinking about it... Haibao must miss his parents too.]

Fishing is a serious business... Your attitude towards fishing will be reflected in your catch.
For example, the extremely precious golden dragonfish only appear in the early morning.]
Start -->1757107586529491[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Boss Lyon takes good care of us. Recently, he asked if I'd consider bringing my family to live in Aoba. Honestly, I've been thinking about it too.]
Start -->1757107589100758[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Fishing is a serious business... Your attitude towards fishing will be reflected in your catch.
For instance, the extremely precious king crab only appears at night.]
Start -->1757107878625497[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Although sunny days are comfortable for people on land, going out to sea to fish is tough. You'll get sunburned.]
Start -->1757107997909212[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

The oarfish only appears during the autumn rainy season. Catching one is really lucky.]
Start -->1758008782489174[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

I'm usually resistant to indulgence, but Boss Lyon said, &quot;You need to relax occasionally, my treat.&quot; So that's why I'm here...
My wife loves to drink. I may not know much about alcohol, but I'm sure she would love the drinks here.]
Start -->1758009218246232[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Once I bring her here to live, I'll take her to this place for a drink.
Alcohol... I need more! Miss Shuten, please bring me another bottle...]
Start -->1758010196168282[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

I heard there are free snacks here, so I came over. I don't have spare money for gambling...]
Start -->1758166563155577[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Everyone dreams of getting rich overnight, but I think it's better to live a steady life than to hope for good luck.]
Start -->1758166810318459[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

When I lived in Shikoku, there weren't many lively festivals like this... I wish my little ones could experience it.]
Start -->1758257619504762[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Enjoy the lively summer night. Goodbye...]
Start -->1758257693513340[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Uozumi:</b>

Hello, welcome to Aoba Town. I am &lbrace;npc.4202&rbrace;.]
