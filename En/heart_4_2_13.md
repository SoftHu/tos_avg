Is this the waiter you were going to send me?
Hmm... seems like a down-to-earth guy.
But waiters are paid a pittance.
Can your Ryoko really wait until then?]

Who made me such a hopeless romantic? 
I just love to see couples make it! Take it easy, Theo. Waiters don't earn 
a decent wage, I can introduce you to a good place with good pay.

I'll put a good word in for you. Wait for my reply.]
