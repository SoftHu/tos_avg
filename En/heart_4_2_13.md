\nIs this the waiter you were going to send me?\nHmm... seems like a down-to-earth guy.
But waiters are paid a pittance.
Can your Ryoko really wait until then?]

\nWho made me such a hopeless romantic? 
I just love to see couples make it! Take it easy, Theo. Waiters don't earn 
a decent wage, I can introduce you to a good place with good pay.\nKababa's new casino is hiring croupiers.
I'll put a good word in for you. Wait for my reply.]

\nIs this the legendary &quot;Health Amulet&quot; blessed by Shinto priests?
I feel a healing power enveloping my body; I'm recovering!\nIt looks like I can start my life all over again.
