Ahhh, this truly is the way to enjoy a drink!
A whole day's work
all for a cold beer at night.
Refreshing, bubbly and a strong banana flavour.
That's really impressive, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
No wonder Yui likes you so much.]

Uhhaha! Sorry,
I'm having a lot of fun today!
Actually, I'm planning to open a tavern outside the casino
and I'm looking for suppliers.
Could I order 30 bottles of beer from you?
Don't worry,
next time I won't drink your beer for free.
5000 gold for 30 bottles, how about that?]

5500 gold, can't do more.
I'll just have to let the Kababa that the price of beer has gone up.]

She's opening a casino in Seikyu

Business is booming just days after opening.
Even Miss Yui, who never drinks,
came to try it out after she heard you made it!
How about that!
Hahaha, isn't my nephew adorable?]

&lbrace;npc.4209&rbrace; told me that you're great at baking,
but didn't expect you to be this good at cooking.
Why not become the tavern's supplier from now on?
I'll talk to the Kababa about this, let you invest in the tavern!
You can supply the tavern with food
and if the tavern sells your dishes,
I'll pay you generously in return.]

Every day after the tavern closes,
I'll have Ritsuryo bring the money to you.]

Actually… well…
a large part of the tavern's income is used to pay off the

Since you're already a supplier for the tavern,
we can make supplying drinks a part of it.
Just like with the food, you restock the tavern

As the tavern becomes more popular,
our sales volume will increase!
Then we can earn more money.
It'll be a joint effort.]
