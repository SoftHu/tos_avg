Ahhh, now that's how you enjoy a beer!
A hard day's work,

Refreshing,

I'm having too much fun today!
I'm planning to open a tavern outside the casino

Can I order 30 bottles of beer from you?
Don't worry,
I'll pay next time.
5000 gold for 30 bottles, how about that?]

You just opened and business is booming.
Even Miss Yui, who never drinks,
came to try it, after hearing you brewed it!
How about that!
Hahaha, isn't my nephew adorable?]

&lbrace;npc.4209&rbrace; told me you're a great baker,
but I didn't expect you to be this good at cooking.
Hey, why don't you become the tavern's supplier?
I'll talk to Kababa and let you know!
You can supply the tavern with the food you cook.
We'll serve your dishes here

our sales will skyrocket!
Then we can make more money.
It'll be a joint effort.]
