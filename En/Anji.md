Even if it's a not-so-fun gift ......
As long as it's from you, it doesn't matter.
But next time maybe you can prepare it a little more attentively.]

Do I look like someone who would be amused by such a gift?
Anger! Hmph!]

In fact, every year today I am in a very low mood, my family is always very busy, they often forget my birthday.
But this year I can have your company and I won't be lonely anymore.]

While you may have had good intentions
But it doesn't seem like anyone would be happy with a birthday gift like that.]
