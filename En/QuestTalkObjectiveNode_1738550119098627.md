Start -->1738550145333510[<b>Speaker 👉 Shrine:</b>

You and &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; have grown up
and don't interact with us as often as you used to.
I know you want to help &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; with transformation,
and today only I can assist you.
But there's one condition...]
1738550145333510 -->1738550565798151{ }
1738550565798151 -->|What're the terms?|1738550618203404[<b>Speaker 👉 Shrine:</b>

&lbrace;location.13&rbrace; is about to face some changes
and I need your help.
You must step up and not refuse my request.
This is also in response to when we chose to shelter you 
and &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace;,
and shared with you the art of transformation.
If you can agree to this,
I will tell you how to help &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; learn human transformation.]
1738550565798151 -->|I'll agree to anything.|1738550822708499[<b>Speaker 👉 Shrine:</b>

In &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;, there is a Fox Spirit Relic,
a once-secret place where foxes worshiped the Inari God.
The ruins of the fox spirits
hold various yokai transformation scrolls,
including those for human forms.
You are only allowed into these ruins as foxes.
Beware of the guardian Gulu Bobo...
Good luck.]

1738550730254605 -->|Why should I trust you?|1738550764796178[<b>Speaker 👉 Shrine:</b>

Have we ever deceived you?
I think of you and &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; as my own children.]
