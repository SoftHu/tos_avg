I got the strawberries fresh from the vendor this morning.]

Can you teach me some recipes?]

Keep trying delicious desserts and you'll get there.]

\nI don't know if you're just stingy about sharing

and he did have a point.\nI really haven't been putting in the effort and 
taking my passion seriously, like other bakers do.\nWithout my title as mayor,
can I still claim I'm passionate about baking?\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;!
I want to audition for the baking show on BYT!]

\n...Thank you all.\nBut I don't feel like being on the show.
I like my life as it is now.\nThe show would take up too much of my time.
I should prioritize doing a good job as mayor,
as it was my father's dying wish.\n...Sorry,
I got carried away.
My apologies.]
