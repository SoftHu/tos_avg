I hope you all like it!
I got the strawberries fresh from the vendor this morning.]

I don't know if you're just stingy about sharing
or if this is your approach to baking.
For a yokai like you,
nobody would encourage you to enter a talent show

I guess I didn't really think how others felt...
But I thought it over carefully
and he did have a point.
I really haven't been putting in the effort and 
taking my passion seriously, like other bakers do.
Without my title as mayor,
can I still claim I'm passionate about baking?

...Thank you all.
But I don't feel like being on the show.
I like my life as it is now.
The show would take up too much of my time.
I should prioritize doing a good job as mayor,

...Sorry,
I got carried away.
My apologies.]
