Be seeing you!]
Start -->1727669228803259[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Greetings, I am Hephaestus, the town's blacksmith.
A long name, I know. Call me Hefi like the others.
If you need any help, feel free to ask.]
Start -->1727669228804285[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Want to lift some weights with me?]
Start -->1727669265736895[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Everything's great here, except news travels slowly.
Not long ago, I was invited to be a judge 
in a renowned sword smithing contest.
But by the time I received the invitation,
the contest had ended more than six months ago...
Absolutely outrageous!!!
Just like that, I missed a once-in-a-life opportunity
to meet and talk to other swordsmiths.]

My father's a dwarf, and my mother's a vampire...
Their child was bound to not be accepted by either race.
I've known this since I was very young.
Preconceived notions are hard to change.
Nevertheless, I had a loving family.
We all face hardships in life.
Oftentimes we just lack the courage to confront them.]
Start -->1727669712214211[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727669712214213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727669712214215[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727669712214217[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727669712215243[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727669712215245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4106.first_name&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727669712215247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4106.first_name&rbrace;!]
Start -->1750913663781145[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Hey, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;, nice to see you again.
I think I worked out too hard the other day.
I might need to rest for a while...]
Start -->1751446334634282[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Hmm... it should be right, but something seems off.
Sorry, I zoned out thinking about the steel ratio.]
Start -->1751446658345260[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's you! What a coincidence...
I was just thinking if &lbrace;playername&rbrace; would come today.
That's just uncanny!]
Start -->1753041040684836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's the Carp Festival again. Really takes me back!
Master Muramasa used to go with me every year.
I can still smell the red bean cakes...]
Start -->1753042058365733[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Let's save our troubles for another day.
Today's all about letting loose!]
Start -->1754981984533008[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

A dog day like this gets me pumped for the festival!
Put on a mask and leave all your worries behind...]
Start -->1754982933656081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

See you soon! Have fun!]
Start -->1756859381660193[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Morning, you seem a little tired...
Did you not sleep well last night?
&#40;Yawning...&#41;
Truth be told, I pulled an all-nighter at the shop.
The moment I relax, sleepiness creeps up on me.]
Start -->1756860676656676[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Master Muramasa said a worthy craftsman
must have a strong physique.
That's why I always work out in the afternoon!]
Start -->1756926446448167[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's been a slow day, so I'm going to have a drink
at the tavern later.
A drink feels like heaven after a long hard day.
Too bad I can't hold my liquor;
three shots and my head is swimming.
And when I wake up it's already the next day.]
Start -->1756928046077482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's raining again...
Ugh, this gloom, it makes me feel down.
All my joints ache on a day like this.]
Start -->1756928373282348[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The other day, I smelled an alluring aroma.
I followed the scent and almost bumped into Miss Oda...
Turns out, the aroma was coming from her.
How should I describe it?
It was like a most delectable dessert.]
Start -->1757728986413649[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm not a kid anymore, but I still have this fear of
getting caught by my master
every time I go to the tavern.
But that just makes it even more tempting...
At a certain point, it has nothing to do with drinking.
You know what I mean?]
Start -->1758010727046748[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Here's a fun fact... Areas where craftsmen gather
often produce famous liquors.
Do you know why?
Because both brewing and blacksmithing
have a common key element - spring water.
The water determines the quality of the product.]
Start -->1758011532116578[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Sorry, I want to be alone for a while.
I'm not in the mood for a chat.]
Start -->1758080850982448[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

O Goddess of Luck, grant me your blessing!
I'm ready to go all out today...]
Start -->1758081818299954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Ever heard of the Principle of Luck Conservation?
If you keep winning, you'll end up losing it all.
But if you keep losing, you might win the next round!]
Start -->1764271909291449[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Maybe it's the nature of the work, but as a craftsman I have a very low presence.
It's nice of you to notice me ......
Gift, I love it!]
Start -->1764271909291451[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I'm still a little uncomfortable about being taken care of by &lbrace;playername&rbrace; all of a sudden hahahaha!
But Master Muramasa said, in the face of kindness, accept it graciously and be grateful.]
Start -->1764271909292477[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Although I don't know if I can accept this gift as a friend ......
But thank you anyway!]
Start -->1764271909292479[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Actually ......
Lol ...... never mind, it doesn't matter.
But &lbrace;playername&rbrace;'s heart matters most.]
Start -->1764271909292481[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

So angry! You leave me alone ......]
Start -->1764271909293507[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Master Muramasa used to help me with my birthday parties, so I miss him every day.
However, now I've decided to start a new chapter!
So, thanks for the company, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1764271909294535[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I've just made a wish to the God of the Forge, and it's about you.
But please allow me to keep the contents a secret for now.]
Start -->1764271909293509[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

I was actually a little apprehensive the other day ......
&lbrace;playername&rbrace; would remember my birthday and get me a present?
Ahahahahahaha, is it weird for me to say that.]
Start -->1764271909294537[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

What? Is this a birthday present?
Well, I'll take it then.]
Start -->1764271909295563[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Perhaps it would have been better if you hadn't remembered my birthday.]
Start -->1764271909295565[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Farewell.]
Start -->1764271909296591[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

See you later.]
Start -->1764271909296593[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Well, we can continue this conversation another time.]
