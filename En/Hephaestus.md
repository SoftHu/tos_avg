See you later!]

Hello, I am the town's blacksmith Hephaestus, but that name is too long. Everyone calls me Heffy, you can call me that too. If you need any help, feel free to ask.]
Start -->1727669228804285[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Want to work out with me?]
Start -->1727669265736895[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Everything's great here, but news travels slowly. I recently got an invitation to judge a renowned swordsmithing contest.
But when I received the invitation, the contest had ended more than six months ago...
That's outrageous!!! Such a rare opportunity for technical exchange wasted.]

My father's a dwarf, and my mother's a vampire... Their child would be rejected by both races.
I've known this since I was very young. After all, inherent views are hard to change.
But that doesn't prevent me from having a loving family. Resistance is everywhere. Many times, we just lack the courage to face it.]

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727669712214213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727669712214215[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727669712214217[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727669712215243[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727669712215245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4106.first_name&rbrace;... We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727669712215247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4106.first_name&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1750913663781145[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Hey, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;, nice to see you again. I think I overdid my workout the other day. I need to rest for a while...]
Start -->1751446334634282[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Hmm... that should be right, but something seems off. Ah! Sorry, I just got carried away thinking about the steel ratios.]
Start -->1751446658345260[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

It's you! What a coincidence... I was just thinking if &lbrace;playername&rbrace; would come to see me today. This might be the telepathy between friends!]
Start -->1753041040684836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

It's the Carp Festival again. This really takes me back! When I was little, Oda would take me every year. I can clearly remember the taste of the red bean cakes.]
Start -->1753042058365733[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Let's forget all our troubles today and relax!]
Start -->1754981984533008[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

The blazing-hot summer days get me in the mood for the festival! Take this chance to wear a mask and leave your troubles and worries behind youâ€¦]
Start -->1754982933656081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

See you later! Have fun!]
Start -->1756859381660193[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Good morning, you don't look very energetic... Did you not sleep well last night? &#40;Yawn...&#41;
To be honest, I also worked all night in the workshop last night. Once you relax, the sleepiness comes.]
Start -->1756860676656676[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Muramasa-sensei said a competent craftsman must have a strong physique, so I always exercise in the afternoon!]
Start -->1756926446448167[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

There are no orders today, so I'm planning to have a drink at the tavern later. After a hard day's work, having a drink is wonderful...
Unfortunately, my alcohol tolerance is low. After three glasses, I lose consciousness, and the next thing I know, it's the next day.]
Start -->1756928046077482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

It's raining again... The weather is so gloomy; it makes me feel down. Every time it rains like this, my joints ache.]
Start -->1756928373282348[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

The other day, I smelled a very tempting aroma. I followed the scent and almost bumped into Miss Oda...
It turns out the aroma was coming from her. How should I describe it? It smelled like some delicious dessert.]
Start -->1757728986413649[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Although I'm not a child anymore, whenever I go to the tavern to drink, I feel like I'm afraid of being caught by my master.
But the more tense and exciting it is, the more attractive it becomes... Sometimes drinking is not the most important thing. Do you understand?]
Start -->1758010727046748[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Let me tell you a fun fact... Areas where craftsmen gather often produce famous sake. Do you know why?
Because both sake brewing and forging have a common key element - spring water. The quality of the spring water directly determines the excellence of the sake and swords.]
Start -->1758011532116578[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Sorry, I want to be alone for a while and don't want to talk.]
Start -->1758080850982448[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Lucky goddess, please bless me! I'm ready to go all out today...]
Start -->1758081818299954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>

Do you know the law of conservation of luck? If you keep winning, you will eventually lose slowly. But if you keep losing, you might win the next round]
