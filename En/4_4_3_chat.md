\nWho goes there?
Trespassing upon the sacred ground of Lady Inari.
State your name!]
1750848156954962 -->|Lady Inari sent me.|1750853271600663[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nA friend of Lady Inari, you say?
I'm not so easily fooled.\nSo, what brings you to these ruins?]

\nNever heard of you.
You're not some criminal, are you?\nWe heard rumors lately that some yokai
are planning on sneaking into the ruins
to steal the transformation scroll from the Fox Spirit.\nIt's not you, is it?
As Gulu Bobo chief guard,
I forbid your entry!]
1750853271600663 -->|I'm searching for the Scroll of Transformation.|1750854219493922[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nYou must be who the Gulu Bobo queen mentioned,
one of the last remaining foxes in the yokai world.\nMy apologies,
I'm just following orders.
just in case you're up to no good.\nEven though you are a fox, I can't just can't tell you where the
scroll is. See this as a test from Lady Inari.
Scared? Well, you'd better turn back.]
1750853271600663 -->|Is it your place to question Lady Inari's decree?|1750854225186339[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nThat's not what I meant.
I've been guarding this place as ordered.]

1750854225186339 -->|His Highness says you're not working hard enough.|1750854340736553[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nNo, no.
Please, let me explain!
It's not what you think with me and Her Majesty...\nMy mistake...
Please come in. I asked a question I shouldn't have.]
1750854225186339 -->|His Highness says you've done well as a guard.|1750854417801770[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nI'll keep up the hard work!
Danger lurks inside the ruins.
Please be careful.]
