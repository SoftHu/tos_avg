\nHo, thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;,
This will help us put the final touches on my forge. 
This is where I will make a Muramasa blade one day. 
\nYou must come visit when it's finished.
Actually, I wanted to ask your advice about the new shop.

1771884965989481 -->|I'm honored.|1771885147568244[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI believe in your vision!
First, where would you put a shop entrance?

\nMakes sense. Next question!
I love making exquisite weaponryâ€¦
But ordinary people require more practical tools. 
\nWhich should I focus on? ]
1771885257513097 -->|Exquisite handicrafts.|1771885330352271[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nHmm, lots to think about!
Now this last one I'm really wrestling with:
\nShould I write Muramasa's name on my sign or use my own? 
The Muramasa name is famous, but I'd also like to make a name for myself.
