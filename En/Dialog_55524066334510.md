\nEveryone really seems to love you two!
Iâ€™ve &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; seen them all come together like thisâ€¦
Theyâ€™re all so happy.\nI hope youâ€™re both settling in well?
Enjoying your new home?]
1776770149381666 -->|Yes! The farmhouse is very comfortable.|1776770230823473[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nSo much of Seikyu used to be built by foxes, for foxes.
Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re in &lbrace;c.farmname&rbrace;.
Itâ€™s only apt that the last fox house is now yours.]
1776770149381666 -->|Weâ€™re getting used to farming.|1776770323120695[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nYouâ€™re doing amazingly!
Everyone seems to think so too.
Youâ€™re natural with the farm.]
1776770230823473 -->1776770343655994[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Fox:</b>
\nYes, itâ€™s perfect for us!]
1776770343655994 -->|Are there other fox buildings in Seikyu?|1776770401877572[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nOh, not really. Though, 
many of the new buildings in town were built over old fox buildings.\nItâ€™s common to find fox holes all around, 
but theyâ€™re mostly abandoned dens or empty.\nWeâ€™re lucky to still have the Fox Ruins.
I have plans to make it a Seikyu Heritage Site. 
What do you think?]
1776770343655994 -->|Who were the last foxes in Seikyu?|1776770598686299[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nMy father and Leon spent a lot of time researching this.
However, even they were unable to figure it out.\nThe disappearance of foxes were so abrupt, 
it even confused the fox ancestors.\nActually, have you met the Gulubo?]
1776770401877572 -->|That sounds like a great honor!|1776770477535824[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nOh, I wish to preserve as much of Seikyuâ€™s fox history as possible.]
1776770401877572 -->|Will you make it into a museum?|1776770537843285[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nOh, no. I wonâ€™t change or add anything to it at all.]
1776770477535824 -->1776770555731544[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI just hope to protect it, like the Gulubo do.
Speaking of which, have you met them yet?]

1776770721026664 -->1776770764008046[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Fox:</b>
\nOohâ€¦ shadow fox! 
That would make a great cosplay!]
1776770764008046 -->1776770876032625[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nHaha. Indeed!
Now, go enjoy your party. 
Lots of yokai want to meet you!]
1776770876032625 -->1776770151461411[End]
444192638932886 -->|Yes, we have.|1776770721026664[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nWell, sometimes, they talk about a fox in the shadows.
Kinn and Ritsu love that story, but itâ€™s just a fable.]
444192638932886 -->|No, we havenâ€™t.|1776770728093291[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nOh, theyâ€™re cute. 
They hang out in the ruins, claiming to guard it!]
