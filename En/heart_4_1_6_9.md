\nYour meddling friend did not listen to the Gulubo. 
He did exactly what we told him not to do.]
1772508511454665 -->1772508621408716{ }
1772508621408716 -->1772508587055563[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYou told me not to, but it is my dreamâ€¦
to make a name for myselfâ€”to become a master. 
I hope you can forgive me.]
1772508621408716 -->1772508549424586[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;â€¦ 
I finished the Muramasa blade. 
It is my greatest achievement as a craftsman.]

1772509546421720 -->1772509588979161[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nYour friend is crazy! 
The inscription is killing him.]
1772509588979161 -->1772509617017306[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nBut now we have a weapon to face whatever the ruins hold. 
and you have the strength to wield it. 
*coughâ€¦ cough]
1772509617017306 -->|Thank you, Heph, I won't let you down.|1772509693489632[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI told youâ€¦
You're what I've been charging toward my whole life. 
If this is what it takes to protect you, I am happy.]

Start -->1772510017487346[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nWe can help the meddler. 
The Gulubo know a ritual to keep the magic from setting in.
It won't stop the curse. But it will hold it back for a while.\nShall we perform the ritual?]
1772510017487346 -->|Why didn't you say anything? Do it, now!|1772510092729848[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nOkayâ€¦
â€¦. â€¦ â€¦]
1772510017487346 -->|Anything to help him.|1772510092729848[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nOkayâ€¦
â€¦. â€¦ â€¦]

\nThere. The meddler is protectedâ€¦ For now.]
1772510155588091 -->1772510175331836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nWow, I already feel better. 
Thank you. 
I'm glad I didn't squish any of you.]
1772510175331836 -->|Heph, are you cured?|1772510225055234[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nAlmost. But not all the way and not forever.]
1772510175331836 -->|So he's alright?|1772510225055234[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nAlmost. But not all the way and not forever.]
1772510225055234 -->1772510249708035[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nWould this ritual work on Nyotengu?]
1772510249708035 -->1772510277314052[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nNo, she's been using her muramasa blade for years. 
the curse has long set in.
Speaking ofâ€¦]
1772510277314052 -->1772510307908101[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;, using that weapon will put your friend in danger again. 
The weapon is only to be used in the ruinsâ€“to face the dark source withinâ€¦\nIf the source is destroyed, the curse could be lifted.]
1772510307908101 -->|I understand.|1772510350461451[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nNow go, Fox &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.	
The meddler needs to rest.]
1772510307908101 -->|I will lift this curse, Heph.|1772510350461451[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ GLP_3:</b>
\nNow go, Fox &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.	
The meddler needs to rest.]
1772510350461451 -->1772510374802956[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nMy muscles are already coming back to life. 
I will see you soon, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.
And take the blade with you. It's yours.]
1772510374802956 -->1772510408566285[End]
443127146763890 -->|Is that why you're so weak?|1772509546421720[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI couldn't curse you with the Muramasa inscription. 
So I took it upon myself. 
And would happily do so again.]
443127146763890 -->|And the inscriptionâ€¦?|1772509546421720[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nI couldn't curse you with the Muramasa inscription. 
So I took it upon myself. 
And would happily do so again.]
