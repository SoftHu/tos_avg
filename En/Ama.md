Welcome!
If you're into fashion, you're in the right place!]

Thanks for visiting! Here at Starlight, we blend
the traditional with the modern,

See youâ€¦]

Everyone's curious about my past...
They wonder why an ex-idol would suddenly retire.
But it's not like that at all...
I just wanted a life like this, so I went for it.
Whether as an idol or a shopkeeper,
I feel super lucky to have come this far!
You see, I'm just an ordinary soul.]
Start -->1727302348199038[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Even after all this time,
some fans from my days as an idol still drop by.
Most are polite... But some of them can't 
accept what I've become, and make a scene.
Honestly, it's quite troubling.
But I understand it all comes from a place of love.
I just hope time will make everything better.]

As rushed as it might be,
we have some kind of social media presence now.
It makes me happy to share design ideas and
the daily routine of running a boutique store.
Yohji has also helped a lot with his connections.
Truly a reliable man.
I was even invited to a fashion week recently.
I'd really like to go.
But I just opened the store and there's
a ton of stuff to do. Looks like I won't be
leaving the island any time soon... Such a pity.]

You've got quite a body!
Would you consider working as a model for me?
Be a shame if you just kept it to yourself, right?
Haha, just kidding...
You seem a little tense.]

How's everything in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;?
I think it's the perfect place for a secluded life... 
Leaving the past behind and starting anew.
Most yokai who come to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; have a
checkered past, but the majority of us find peace here.]

I heard Inari Okami possesses otherworldly beauty.
Wonder if my designs will be able to match thatâ€¦
She probably prefers elegant and traditional kimonos
rather than trendy and fashionable clothing, right?
Maybe blending the classic and the trendy
could be a good design approach.]

Miss &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; and I made a lot of flags
for the festival. I love seeing them flying...
Happy Carp Festival, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!]

The Summer Festival is my favorite, you know?
Everyone is dressed in gorgeous yukatas.
It's such a unique sight!]
Start -->1754979887910413[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Exactly, we can't squander such wonderful moments.
Have an amazing time!]

When I received this gift, it reminded me of my time in show business.
At that time, although I had a lot of fans, I didn't have many friends.
Now although I don't have fans anymore, I have gained a lot of good friends.]
Start -->1763569384140486[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Thank you for the gift! Do you need my autograph?
How about &quot;To Sign&quot;?
Haha, don't mind me, I'm just kidding. ......]
Start -->1763569384140488[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1763569384140490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Well, it's a token of your appreciation anyway.
I'll take it ......]
Start -->1763569384141516[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Isn't this kind of gift a little too rude?]
Start -->1763569384141518[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

I was really surprised to receive a gift from &lbrace;playername&rbrace; on my birthday!
I can tell you've been observing my preferences ......]
Start -->1763569384142544[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Is it a birthday present for me?
Gosh ...... what a great gift!
Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!]
Start -->1763569384142546[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
Didn't forget my birthday and brought such a nice gift.]
Start -->1763569384142548[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Well, anyway, it was great to remember my birthday ......]
Start -->1763569384143574[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Are we still friends?
Don't you think it's too much to send such a gift on my birthday?]
Start -->1763569384143576[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Going away? I'll feel lonely ......]
Start -->1763569384143578[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>

Bye.]
