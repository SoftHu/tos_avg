\nWelcome!
If you're into fashion, you're in the right place!]
Start -->1727301435705462[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nThanks for visiting! Here at Starlight, we blend
the traditional with the modern,
offering you a unique shopping experience!]

\nSee youâ€¦]

\nEveryone's curious about my past...
They wonder why an ex-idol would suddenly retire.
But it's not like that at all...\nI just wanted a life like this, so I went for it.
Whether as an idol or a shopkeeper,
I feel super lucky to have come this far!\nYou see, I'm just an ordinary soul.]
Start -->1727302348199038[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nEven after all this time,
some fans from my days as an idol still drop by.\nMost are polite... But some of them can't 
accept what I've become, and make a scene.\nHonestly, it's quite troubling.
But I understand it all comes from a place of love.
I just hope time will make everything better.]

\nAs rushed as it might be,
we have some kind of social media presence now.\nIt makes me happy to share design ideas and
the daily routine of running a boutique store.\nYohji has also helped a lot with his connections.
Truly a reliable man.\nI was even invited to a fashion week recently.
I'd really like to go.\nBut I just opened the store and there's
a ton of stuff to do. Looks like I won't be
leaving the island any time soon... Such a pity.]

\nYou've got quite a body!
Would you consider working as a model for me?\nBe a shame if you just kept it to yourself, right?\nHaha, just kidding...
You seem a little tense.]
Start -->1727312747573430[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nOh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727312747573432[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nThank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727312747573434[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727312747574460[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nAlthough I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727312747574462[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nAre you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727312747574464[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727312747575490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace;!]
Start -->1740294009384150[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nHow's everything in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;?
I think it's the perfect place for a secluded life... 
Leaving the past behind and starting anew.\nMost yokai who come to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; have a
checkered past, but the majority of us find peace here.]

\nI heard Lady Inari possesses otherworldly beauty.
Wonder if my designs will be able to match thatâ€¦\nShe probably prefers elegant and traditional kimonos
rather than trendy and fashionable clothing, right?\nMaybe blending the classic and the trendy
could be a good design approach.]

\nMiss &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; and I made a lot of flags
for the festival. I love seeing them flying...
Happy Carp Festival, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753038002806561[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nHave a blast!
Don't forget to go see &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;!]

\nThe Summer Festival is my favorite, you know?
Everyone is dressed in gorgeous yukatas.
It's such a unique sight!]
Start -->1754979887910413[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ama:</b>
\nExactly, we can't squander such wonderful moments.
Have an amazing time!]
