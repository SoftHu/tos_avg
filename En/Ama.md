Everyone's curious about my past... Wondering if there's a secret behind a former idol's sudden retirement. But it's not like that at all...
I just wanted this life, so I went for it. Whether as an idol or now, I'm super lucky to have come this far!
Look, I'm just an ordinary person.]
Start -->1727302348199038[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Miss Ama:</b>

Even after all this time, some fans from my days as an idol still drop by.
Most are polite... But some fans can't accept reality and make a scene.
Honestly, it's troubling, but I get it all comes from a place of love. Hopefully, time will heal all.]

As rushed as it might be, our shop's social media is finally on track.
Sharing design ideas and the daily routine of running a shop make me happy.
Yosuke has helped me a lot with his connections. Truly a reliable and good man.
I recently received an invitation to a fashion week held by the industry. I'd really like to go.
But the shop is new and needs to be taken care of. Looks like I won't be leaving the island any time soon... Such a pity.]

Your physique is great! Have you considered being my personal model?
It'd be a waste not to show off such a great figure, right?
Haha, just kidding... You seem a little tense.]

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727312747573432[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Miss Ama:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727312747573434[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Miss Ama:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727312747574460[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Miss Ama:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727312747574462[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Miss Ama:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727312747574464[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace;... We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727312747575490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4205&rbrace; now!]

How's everything in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;? I think it's really suited to a secluded life... Leaving the past behind and starting anew.
Most yokai who come to &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; have their complicated pasts, but the majority of us find peace here.]

I heard Inari-sama is a rare beauty. Wonder if my designs will complement such beautyâ€¦
But she probably prefers elegant and traditional kimonos rather than trendy and fashionable clothing, right?
Maybe blending the classic and the trendy could be a good design approach.]

Happy Carp Festival, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;! Miss &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; and I made many Carp Festival flags. Seeing them flutter in the wind always moves me...]

Have fun! Don't forget to check out &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;!]

Did you know? The Summer Festival is my favorite. Everyone dresses in beautiful yukatas. It's such a unique sight!]

True, we shouldn't waste such wonderful moments. Have fun!]
