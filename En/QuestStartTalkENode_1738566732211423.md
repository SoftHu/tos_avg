Greetings, &lbrace;playername&rbrace; and &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace;!
We heard you were planning to settle in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;.
We're glad you found a place to call home.
When you pay respects at a shrine,
the fox spirits will look favorably upon you,
and grant you the power of teleportation back to it.
Take good care of your sister, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
We wish you both good fortune. 
Farewell.]
