\nIt's been a long time since I met a
fishing buddy willing to go out to sea with me.
Usually, it's &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace; and &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; who accompany me.]
1756241844907531 -->|Where's &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;?|1756242060035602[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\n&lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; seems a bit hesitant whenever he sees me.
He probably prefers fishing on the pond.\nBut you should understand
that a real man needs the sea, not a pond.]
1756241844907531 -->|Find me again next time.|1756242055346705[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\nI'm happy to hear that.]

\nOur boss was the leader of the Furious Waves back in the day, 
a true godfather of the sea.]
1756242205476373 -->|Mafia?|1756242572664354[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\nHaha,
some people might think that.
But I'd rather call us heroes of the past.]
1756242205476373 -->|Godfather of the Sea?|1756242494737952[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\nWell, &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace;... 
that's what we used to call each other when we were young. 
Now I'm just the old man at the fish shop.]

You got a bite! Didn't expect your luck to be so good.
You'll feast with &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; tonight!\nRemember to invite me to your farmhouse next time.]

\nYou know, the bigger the tuna, the richer the oil.
The feeling of it melting in your mouth
is a true gift of nature.]
1756243312888372 -->1756243528953404[<b>Speaker 👉 Shuten:</b>
\nHaha, our luck was good today.
I was worried we'd come back
empty-handed and disappoint the kids.]
1756243528953404 -->1756243408125499[<b>Speaker 👉 Seabert:</b>
\nWith Uncle around,
we could never come back empty-handed.]

\nOh, by the way...
Have you found any clues about &lbrace;npc.4203.nick_name&rbrace;?]
1756244135153252 -->|What happened?|1756244695127658[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\nNope! Once I catch this scammer,
I'll make sashimi of them.\nBefore I retired,
he set up a big scheme against us.
He owes us a lot of money.]

1756244695127658 -->|Set up a scheme?|1756244773002864[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>
\nOnce he asked us to transport
a batch of goods to Seikyu.\nHe said the goods were precious
and had to be closely guarded.\nHe promised us 50,000 gold coins as payment.\nWhen escorting the goods,
we were pursued by a group of tanukis, sustaining severe
damage to our ship, and many brothers were badly injured.\nOf course, the goods still reached Seikyu safely.
As maritime escorts, 
we've never let anyone down.]

\nRight! That's exactly right. 
He didn't even try to pay for the goods before vanishing in Seikyu.]

\nSorry for making you come all this way.\nI've been preparing a birthday gift for a friend recently. 
A handmade fishing rod!\nAlthough she doesn't seem to like fishing,
I still hope she likes it.]

because I think Miss Ama actually prefers more luxurious,
exquisite things.\nHaha, thinking about it,
she might find my gift a bit odd.]
