It's been a long time since I met a
fishing buddy willing to go out to sea with me.
Usually, it's &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace; and &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; who accompany me.]

1756241863062028 -->|Find me again next time.|1756242055346705[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

I'm happy to hear that.]
1756241863062028 -->|Where's &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;?|1756242060035602[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

&lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace; seems a bit hesitant whenever he sees me.
He probably prefers fishing on the pond.
But you should understand
that a real man needs the sea, not a pond.]

Our boss was the leader of the Furious Waves back in the day, 
a true godfather of the sea.]

1756242364686874 -->|Godfather of the Sea?|1756242494737952[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

Well, &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace;... 
that's what we used to call each other when we were young. 
Now I'm just the old man at the fish shop.]
1756242364686874 -->|Mafia?|1756242572664354[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

Haha,
some people might think that.
But I'd rather call us heroes of the past.]

1756242607330851 -->|That's so cool!|1756242629922344[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

I didn't expect to find young people like you, who still think like that.
I'll introduce you to my other brothers later.]
1756242607330851 -->|Mind if I join you?|1756242654160426[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

Haha,
I've retired now.
I'm just a fish shop owner.]

You got a bite!
You got a bite! Didn't expect your luck to be so good.
You'll feast with &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace; tonight!
Remember to invite me to your farmhouse next time.]

You know, the bigger the tuna, the richer the oil.
The feeling of it melting in your mouth
is a true gift of nature.]

Haha, our luck was good today.
I was worried we'd come back
empty-handed and disappoint the kids.]
1756243528953404 -->1756243408125499[<b>Speaker 👉 Seabert:</b>

With Uncle around,
we could never come back empty-handed.]

Ah, I envy you, Seabert. Mum can't cook at all.]
1756243872197198 -->1756243921078879[<b>Speaker 👉 Kinntarou:</b>

But Mum sure can brew sake!]

Have you found any clues about &lbrace;npc.4203.nick_name&rbrace;?]
1756244135153252 -->1756244695127658[<b>Speaker 👉 Torleone:</b>

Nope! Once I catch this scammer,
I'll make sashimi of them.
Before I retired,
he set up a big scheme against us.
He owes us a lot of money.]

Once he asked us to transport
a batch of goods to Seikyu.
He said the goods were precious
and had to be closely guarded.
He promised us 50,000 gold coins as payment.
When escorting the goods,
we were pursued by a group of tanukis, sustaining severe
damage to our ship, and many brothers were badly injured.
Of course, the goods still reached Seikyu safely.
As maritime escorts, 
we've never let anyone down.]

No, we could find no trace of him

next to the fish shop.]

Right! That's exactly right. 
He didn't even try to pay for the goods before vanishing in Seikyu.]

I'll take you to see those goods next time...

Sorry for making you come all this way.
I've been preparing a birthday gift for a friend recently. 
A handmade fishing rod!
Although she doesn't seem to like fishing,
I still hope she likes it.]

I added a scarf
because I think Miss Ama actually prefers more luxurious,
exquisite things.

If she doesn't like it, there's nothing I can do.]

After all, I'm just a simple man, so I came to ask you,
