Murphy ...... Murphy ...... With all due respect, you're not hitting on me, are you?
Ah, I understand.
When I see such a handsome and handsome river boy on the road, I can't help but want to get close.
But I'm not one to fool around, mind you.
I can't tell you too much, I must maintain an air of mystery.]
Start -->1753055133671233[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Why do carps get their own festival,
while we kappas are never celebrated?
Not fair!]
Start -->1753055139179330[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Regardless, it's a holiday.
It's time to go and have some fun.]
Start -->1727402147656814[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

You can talk to me anytime ......
Although we're not quite acquainted, isn't friendship and love born from strangeness to familiarity?
I've heard a little gossip that I'm happy to share.
Boss Torleone, the otter of the docks, seems to have a bit of a thing for Ms. Ama. ......
Don't ask me how I know. It's my pure love radar, of course!]
Start -->1757018621542495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Don't you feel we were destined to meet?
To be honest, from the moment I saw you,
I knew you were the one I'd been looking for.
There's no question about it.
We kappas are naturally good at this stuff.
In our village, this is nothing extraordinary.
Everyone can do it...
I thought folk from the outside had this talent too.]
Start -->1757021088599138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

There're so many misunderstandings about us...
Yes, we love living in water,
but that doesn't mean we're as ugly as frogs!
In fact, there's no shortage of beautiful kappas.
You're looking at one right now!
I'm telling you, those legends are very wrong...
Nothing but slander and badmouthing!]
Start -->1757021604037733[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh! It's you ......
Be careful of heatstroke in the hot summer.
In fact, as river children, we are the tribe that is most afraid of summer.
If the hot sun dries up the moisture on the top of your head, you'll be screwed ah!]
Start -->1757991264677438[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Bitter wine brings pain to my heart...
I never thought a prince such as I would
have his heart broken.]
Start -->1757992321541696[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Miss Shuten's brew would be highly appreciated 
by the kappa elders in our village!
They have very high standards, as you'd expect of kappa.]
Start -->1757993019308610[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Did you know? Just sitting here,
I get hit on four or five times a night.
Being so popular is such a hassle.]
Start -->1758101022067305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The casino owner made a huge mistake letting me in.
Well, I'm going to teach them a lesson.
Mwahahaha!
Don't they know we kappas are master cheaters?]
Start -->1758101238852203[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Winning money is as easy as drinking water for me...]
Start -->1758250107891293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Such an important holiday should be spent with
someone important, right?
Say, you came here to see me?]
Start -->1758250182563423[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Don't be a stranger!]
Start -->1764182741534085[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I told you ......&lbrace;playername&rbrace; you must have a crush on me, right?
Otherwise it's hard to explain why this gift is so perfect for me!]
Start -->1764182741534087[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I get it ...... I get it all ......
Even though you're embarrassed to show your love, I see this gift and I get it all.]
Start -->1764182741535113[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

This thought from &lbrace;playername&rbrace; is worth a million cucumbers.]
Start -->1764182741535115[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

In fact, between us, we don't need gifts to sustain us, do we?
I understand your feelings, and you understand mine.
That's enough.]
Start -->1764182741536141[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; is so naughty, she must have been trying to see if doing that would anger me.
I wouldn't be disappointed in &lbrace;playername&rbrace; for something so trivial!]
Start -->1764182741536143[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

To receive a gift from the most important &lbrace;playername&rbrace; at such an important time.
Even if it means I won't see the sun tomorrow, I'm willing!]
Start -->1764182741536145[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Did you know that? For us river children, our birthday is our lucky day of the year!
I'm really lucky to receive your gift ......]
Start -->1764182741537171[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

A birthday gift from &lbrace;playername&rbrace; has a special meaning to me.]
Start -->1764182741537173[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

As long as &lbrace;playername&rbrace; likes it, I like it.
You must have put so much effort into preparing a gift just to make me happy, right?]
Start -->1764182741537175[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Anyway, &lbrace;playername&rbrace; for remembering my birthday ......
That would be the luckiest thing for me!]
Start -->1764182741540249[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

See you later, honey.]
Start -->1764182741540251[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I understand. You have your own thing going on.
I'll give you plenty of personal space ......]
Start -->1764182741541277[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I'll be waiting for you to come back to me, honey.]
Start -->1764905520207583[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

From the first moment I saw you, I couldn't help but fantasize about our future together.
I'm sorry, I don't know if I'm offending you by saying this.
But please believe me, this is my true feeling.]
Start -->1764906050037473[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's so hot. We usually stay underwater in weather like this.
But I've decided to live in Seikyu.
So I'll try to adapt to the climate here.]
Start -->1764906080534243[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Don't you think it's been too hot this summer?
I think I'll go back tonight and fill the bathtub with ice cubes
And have a nice ice cube bath.]
Start -->1764906092137189[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Really strange ......
It is reasonable to say that I have left Hetong Village for such a long time, the village chief should have sent a small team to arrest me back.
But my life is actually so calm and unruffled.]
Start -->1764906101972711[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh, what a coincidence! You're here too.
I think it must be God's arrangement for us to meet.
If you'd come to me every day, I wouldn't be so lonely and forlorn.]
Start -->1764910167581417[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Fall is in full swing, but the air is just a little dry yet.
My skin is getting a little dry, but unfortunately there are no beauty parlors here.
The moistness of your skin is an important health indicator for a river kid.]
Start -->1764910167582443[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Autumn is the season of harvest, but when will I harvest the fruits of my love ......
I didn't realize it's been so long since I came to Seikyu, but I still have nothing to show for it.]
Start -->1764910167582445[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Autumn is very suitable for eating hot Kanto Oh ......
No matter what kind of dish, if you put it into a big pot and boil it, it's all delicious.
Perhaps the key is the soup base itself!
What a shame, if only I had learned the recipe for the soup base before I left Hetong Village.]
Start -->1764910167584495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

When I was in Hetong Village, I had almost no rivals in terms of face value.
I didn't realize that Seikyu Town's crouching tigers and hidden dragons would actually cause me to have face anxiety for the first time.
Damn it! I can't believe that even my Prince has a day to worry about his face value.]
Start -->1764910167584497[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Although I miss my life in Kawagoe Village from time to time
But Seikyu is in a way a better place for me to live.
Seawater bathing firms up my skin, and I've fallen in love with this place!]
Start -->1764910486572787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's amazing how our friendship has gone on for four seasons.
We have been together for a long time, and we cherish this bond.
I think our story is still long ......]
Start -->1764910486572789[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Today's temperature is very low, and as a community with no body hair to cover us, we are even more afraid of the cold.
You should also remember to wear more clothes, although it is said that fools do not catch cold ......
Don't look like that!
You haven't understood my feelings for so long, you're not an idiot!]
Start -->1764910486573815[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

In the cold season, I thirst for a warm embrace ......
Forget it, it's nothing, you wouldn't understand if I told you anyway.]
Start -->1764910486573817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's so important to keep your zest for life even in cold weather!
I'm planning to try 20 kilometers of winter swimming!
This kind of program is a great challenge even for the hippo community.]
Start -->1764910486574843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh, it's you! It's you.
Don't stay out too long in this weather. We'll all be worried if you get frostbite.
Of course, I'm the one who's most worried about you.]
Start -->1764911690538749[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Hello, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
Uh ...... I'm actually a little unsure how to face you.
I'm still a little hurt that you rejected my cucumber bouquet last time ......
Perhaps time will slowly heal my wounds.
But I still want you to consider my request ......]
Start -->1764911690538751[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I thought you would avoid me because of what happened before ......
But since you took the initiative to talk to me, I'd better forgive you!]
Start -->1764911690539777[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Did you know? Hetong village is an isolated place where life is simple.
I thought I was going to spend an ordinary life like my ancestors, but I was destined to be extraordinary.
So even if it means violating the village rules, I still choose to leave Hetong Village.
The river boy village has a specially trained special guard, and in the past, river boys who sneaked out of the village were arrested by them.
Otherwise, I would say that Prince I am extraordinary, I seem to be the only river boy who managed to escape the village.]
Start -->1764911690540803[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Maybe it's because of the same aquatic community, I always feel close to Ms. Ama when I see her.
She used to be a romantic, but now her doesn't seem to believe in love.
Although I don't know what she went through, I think it must have been a tragic past.]
Start -->1764911690541829[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Why do Seikyu residents wear bathing suits when they swim? It's baffling ......
Isn't it great that everyone in the river village is open and honest?
Not to mention that swimming will be freer without the fabric in the way.
What's even more puzzling is that I was warned by Oda-sama when I chose not to wear a bathing suit in the water!
What does the word &quot;indecent&quot; mean? Does it mean I shouldn't be so charming?
It's so annoying to be handsome.]
Start -->1764911690541831[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Have you ever noticed that the spring sea breeze is so enchanting with its floral and grassy scent?
Such dry and refreshing odors are unfamiliar to the river children.
Maybe it's nice to stop your busy life once in a while
It would be nice to simply enjoy an afternoon at the beach with nothing to do.
Of course, it would be doubly nice to be accompanied by a lover.]
Start -->1764911690542857[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh! It's you... you sure have a pep in your step!
Miss me yet?
Don't forget to think of me every day, okay?
Don't worry, I'll think of you every day too!
Love you!]
Start -->1764911690542859[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Speaking of which, Oda-sama, despite her young age, has a special sense of leadership!
If I had to describe her, she really looks like the head of our Kappa Village.
A good old man who is a bit of a nag, but who really cares about everyone.]
Start -->1764911690543885[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Summer is the best time to make pickled cucumbers.
Cucumbers are delicious any way you make them, but the crunchy &quot;Hetong Overnight Pickle&quot; is worth savoring.
However, I don't seem to have much talent in cooking, so I tried a few times but failed.]
Start -->1764911690543887[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

The summer heat is really a huge test for the river kids ......
I actually snuck into the ruins earlier to cool off.
There's not a lot of disturbance there and the air is humid, just a bit eerie.]
Start -->1764911690544913[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh, it's you ......
I'm working on a haiku that celebrates fall!
It's such a challenging thing to formulate words.
It seems that it really does take talent to become a poet.
But I've heard that foxes are natural poets.
Have you ever considered writing a haiku?]
Start -->1764911690544915[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's easy to get melancholy in the fall yet, and all kinds of worries and thoughts start to fill the air.
Many people hate fall more than winter and summer.
But for me, such worries don't exist.
Will there be anyone who doesn't like a melancholy Prince?
Let the handsome me sweep away the gloom in everyone's heart!]
Start -->1764911690544917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Nah! Listen to me, don't you think Torleone the Otter has a lot of secrets about him?
He seems to unconsciously show a fierce expression when he's in a relaxed state ......
Looks like a dangerous person who would take out the other person just because of a single word of disagreement!
For your safety, it's better if you stay away from him ......]
Start -->1764911690545943[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Today, Shuten Big Sister talked to me a lot about the past of Hetong Village ......
I never thought that Shuten would come to our village before I was born.
I thought the Hetong Village was isolated from the world and didn't allow outsiders to enter!]
Start -->1764911690545945[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

You still can't forget me!
I understand, even though you rejected me, your heart is caught up in hesitation and self-reproach.
I'll wait forever for your reply!]
Start -->1764911690546971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Even on such a cold day, you have to specially come out to talk to me ......
You really love me, don't you?
I told you! No one can match the charm of this Prince.]
Start -->1764911690546973[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's so cold ...... I'm dying for a fire.
I think I see my great-great-great-grandmother ......]
Start -->1764911690547999[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Ms. Ama believes that winter clothes shouldn't be too bulky
There are times when the need for warmth can be sacrificed in part for fashion sense and styling considerations.
This is simply ridiculous!
Even as handsome as I am, it's hard to sacrifice your health for poise yet.]
Start -->1764911690548001[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh! It's you ......
I was thinking about whether or not I should go to Shuten-chan's store for a drink tonight.
After all, you always have to rely on the succor of alcohol to get through the cold winter months, don't you?]
Start -->1764911690549027[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I didn't realize that in the blink of an eye, a year would be almost gone.
I still remember the scene when we first met it ...... is really nostalgic.
Really strange, I am not a sentimental person, how can I say this for good reason.]
Start -->1764913124333389[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Good day, my dear!
A beautiful spring day goes best with a sweet kiss ......
Don't you think so?]
Start -->1764913195637583[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I'm so sleepy, this season is so uninspiring.
One should just sleep beautifully, right?
Hedo's health tips should be promoted to everyone here ......]
Start -->1764913205617489[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Ah! Harvest season ......
An ounce of time is worth a pound of gold, and fall is precious, isn't it?
I think you should go do something about it.]
Start -->1764913217741651[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Cold weather always makes people lazy ......
A great time is simply wasted.]
Start -->1764913273795413[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Ah ...... wonderful spring night!
Did you know? Spring night is the most important breeding time for the Hippogriff clan.
It must mean a lot for you to come to me at this time.]
Start -->1764913273796439[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Noisy Cicadas ...... Do those guys have to be so loud?
This is even worse for my already fragile sleep.]
Start -->1764913273796441[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

The chief of Hedo Village doesn't allow us to leave the village without permission.
But everyone would sneak out to play in the dark!
So we're no strangers to lively nights.]
Start -->1764913273796443[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

On cold winter nights, we Riverkids usually stay under the thick ice to hibernate.
The climate above ground is really still too cold ......]
Start -->1764913406229343[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Silky spring rain falls on the body, causing thousands of lovesick sadness ......
For us Hedonists, the falling rain in spring symbolizes the love that is sought but not given.]
Start -->1764913406229341[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Rainy days are wonderful as I can roam freely.
The rain nourishes my skin,
and I feel more and more handsome by the second!]
Start -->1764913406229345[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

The fall rains are always accompanied by a biting coolness, a solemnity that symbolizes death.
It is signaling us that the cold winter is just around the corner.]
Start -->1764913406230371[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

What is the white powder falling from the sky?
Is it salt? Or frosting?]
Start -->1764978453968741[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Boss Torleone said that the word &quot;benevolence and righteousness&quot; is the most important word when you are on the road.
He relied on these two words to lead the Raging Wave Group to make a name for themselves on the sea.
It seems that if I want to fulfill my career, I have to implement these two words as well.
So, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;, being my dear friend, will definitely support me, right?]
Start -->1764978453969767[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; I'm sure you like to talk to me, but that's okay, Prince likes to talk to you too.
If something is bothering you, please feel free to talk to me.
You know, I'll do anything for you.]
Start -->1764978453969769[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Does &lbrace;playername&rbrace; fantasize that he could be a millionaire someday?
If I were to become super rich, the first thing I would want to do is build a cucumber palace.
It would be so nice to wake up from my cucumber bed every day.
The second thing you'll ask &lbrace;playername&rbrace; is what's your wish.
After all, it's something to be proud of to help a friend fulfill a wish.]
Start -->1764979728672619[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

So there's a lot of activity in the town during the carp festival ......
It's a very festive atmosphere!
This is a good chance for this Prince to show off, so don't steal my thunder.]
Start -->1764979728672621[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

It's the Carp Festival today, and this Prince has a lot of work to do, so let's leave it at that!]
Start -->1764979912296303[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Goodbye, my dear friend!]
