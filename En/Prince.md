\nBye.]
Start -->1727401749323882[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nDay after day, year after year... so boring!]
Start -->1727401749323884[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nI'd love to see the outside world... 
You feel the same, right?]
Start -->1727640070775924[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nHey, nicely done!
Thanks a lotâ€¦]
Start -->1727640070775926[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nYou're too kind...
I appreciate your generosity
and I really like what you gave meâ€¦]
Start -->1727640070776952[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nThank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727640070776954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nThis...
Ugh...]
Start -->1727640070776956[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nAre you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727640070777982[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727640070777984[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1740649883864278[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nCould it be... could it be...
Excuse my bluntness, but are you flirting with me?\nAh, I get it.
Seeing such a handsome kappa on the road,
you couldn't resist getting a little closer.\nBut I'm not one to fool around, mind you.
I can't tell you too much, I must maintain an air of mystery.]
Start -->1753055133671233[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nWhy do carps get their own festival,
while we kappas are never celebrated?
Not fair!]
Start -->1753055139179330[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nRegardless, it's a holiday.
It's time to go and have some fun.]
Start -->1727402147656814[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nYou can always come chat with me...
I'll never tire of talking to you.
After all, we have something special.\nBy the way, I heard some steamy gossip.
I don't mind sharing it with you!\nIt seems that Torleone has a thing for Miss Ama...
How do I know?
My Crush Radar was working overtime!]
Start -->1757018621542495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nDon't you feel we were destined to meet?
To be honest, from the moment I saw you,
I knew you were the one I'd been looking for.\nThere's no question about it.
We kappas are naturally good at this stuff.\nIn our village, this is nothing extraordinary.
Everyone can do it...
I thought folk from the outside had this talent too.]
Start -->1757021088599138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nThere're so many misunderstandings about us...
Yes, we love living in water,
but that doesn't mean we're as ugly as frogs!\nIn fact, there's no shortage of beautiful kappas.
You're looking at one right now!\nI'm telling you, those legends are very wrong...
Nothing but slander and badmouthing!]
Start -->1757021604037733[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nOh! It's you... you sure have a pep in your step!
Miss me yet?
Don't forget to think of me every day, okay?\nDon't worry, I'll think of you every day too!
Love you!]
Start -->1757022289873000[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nGood morning, my love!
A beautiful morning should start with a sweet kiss,
don't you think?]
Start -->1757022783148139[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nSo sleepy. We shouldn't do anything at this hour!
Except for a nice, long nap, am I right?
That's how we stay healthy; everybody should do it.]
Start -->1757023441983599[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nOur village chief doesn't allow us to leave
without permission, but everyone just sneaks out
under the cover of night!]
Start -->1757024591266929[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nSunny days are dreadful, don't you think?
The moment I get out of water, the dew
on my head slowly evaporates under the sun.\nI really feel like I could die anytime and anywhere...]
Start -->1757024657764467[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nRainy days are wonderful as I can roam freely.
The rain nourishes my skin,
and I feel more and more handsome by the second!]
Start -->1757991264677438[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nBitter wine brings pain to my heart...
I never thought a prince such as I would
have his heart broken.]
Start -->1757992321541696[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nMiss Shuten's brew would be highly appreciated 
by the kappa elders in our village!
They have very high standards, as you'd expect of kappa.]
Start -->1757993019308610[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nDid you know? Just sitting here,
I get hit on four or five times a night.
Being so popular is such a hassle.]
Start -->1758101022067305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nThe casino owner made a huge mistake letting me in.
Well, I'm going to teach them a lesson.
Mwahahaha!\nDon't they know we kappas are master cheaters?]
Start -->1758101238852203[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nWinning money is as easy as drinking water for me...]
Start -->1758250107891293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nSuch an important holiday should be spent with
someone important, right?
Say, you came here to see me?]
Start -->1758250182563423[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>
\nDon't be a stranger!]
