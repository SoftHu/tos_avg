Bye.]
Start -->1727401749323882[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Day after day, year after year... so boring!]
Start -->1727401749323884[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

I'd love to see the outside world... 
You feel the same, right?]
Start -->1727640070775924[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Hey, nicely done!
Thanks a lotâ€¦]
Start -->1727640070775926[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

So polite...
I appreciate your generosity
and I really like what you gave meâ€¦]
Start -->1727640070776952[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727640070776954[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

This...
Ugh...]
Start -->1727640070776956[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727640070777982[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727640070777984[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1740649883864278[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Could it be... could it be...
Excuse my bluntness, but you're not flirting with me, are you?
Ah, I get it.
Seeing such a handsome Kappa on the road,
you couldn't resist getting closer.
None]
Start -->1753055133671233[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Why do carps get their own festival
while we Kappa are never celebrated?
It's not fair!]
Start -->1753055139179330[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Regardless, it's a festival day. It's time to go and have some fun.]
Start -->1727402147656814[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

You can always come to chat with me... I'll never get tired of talking to you. After all, our relationship is quite special.
By the way, I heard some interesting gossip. I don't mind sharing it with you!
It seems that Lyon, the boss at the dock, has a thing for Miss Emma... How do I know? My pure love radar detected it, of course!]
Start -->1757018621542495[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Don't you think our meeting was guided by the god of fate? Actually, from the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one I've been looking for.
Don't doubt it, it's just a little innate talent of us kappa.
This is nothing unusual in our kappa village. Everyone can do it... I thought people outside had this talent too.]
Start -->1757021088599138[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

There seem to be a lot of misunderstandings about kappa... Yes, we love living in the water, but that doesn't mean we are as ugly as frogs!
On the contrary, we have many handsome and beautiful individuals among us. For example, look at me standing in front of you!
So those legends are mostly misunderstandings... It's slander! It's bad press! It's damaging to our image!]
Start -->1757021604037733[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Oh! It's you... so energetic today! Did you miss me? You must think of me every day, okay?
Don't worry, I'll think of you every day too! Love you~]
Start -->1757022289873000[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Good morning, dear~ A beautiful morning should start with a sweet kiss, don't you think?]
Start -->1757022783148139[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

So sleepy, we shouldn't do anything at this time! We should just have a nice nap, right? The kappa's secret to health should be shared with everyone...]
Start -->1757023441983599[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Although the village chief doesn't allow us to leave the village without permission, everyone sneaks out to play under the cover of night!]
Start -->1757024591266929[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Don't you think sunny days are scary? As soon as I leave the water, the dew on my head slowly evaporates under the sun.
It feels like facing the threat of death anytime, anywhere...]
Start -->1757024657764467[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Rainy days are wonderful, I can roam freely~ The rain nourishes my skin, making me feel more handsome!]
Start -->1757991264677438[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Bitter wine brings pain to the heart... I never thought a prince like me would experience heartbreak.]
Start -->1757992321541696[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Miss Shuten's brewing skills would be highly appreciated even in the kappa village! Oh, the elders in the kappa village are experts in wine tasting. Their standards are very high, as expected of kappa.]
Start -->1757993019308610[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Did you know? Just sitting here, I get hit on four or five times a night. Sigh, being too popular is a hassle.]
Start -->1758101022067305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

This casino dared to let me in, so I must make the owner suffer a bit and learn a lesson, hahaha!
Doesn't he know that kappa are very good at cheating?]
Start -->1758101238852203[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Winning money is as easy as drinking water for me...]
Start -->1758250107891293[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Such an important festival should be spent with someone important, right? So, did you come to find me?]
Start -->1758250182563423[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Prince:</b>

Remember to come and play with me again!]
