\nGood, youâ€™ve made it to the fox ruins. ]
1773747748356434 -->1773747758125396[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nAnd you've uncovered all the shrines!]
1773747758125396 -->|What is this place?|1773747798718818[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nThis was the great fox den, once the epicenter of our culture. 
Itâ€™s where we learned our shapeshifting powers, 
And worshipped our patron, Inari, goddess of transformation.  
\nTo explore these depthsâ€¦
You'll have to make offerings, solve puzzles, and fight angry spirits.
The Fox clan has always guarded its knowledge fiercely. 
\nBut itâ€™s worth the effort.
These ruins hold the answers to all of our questions. 
\nIt is the key to unlocking your powers and our best hope to find your parents. ]

\nAnd all the other Foxes!]
1773747869768039 -->1773747882534249[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nBut don't go until you're ready!]
1773747882534249 -->1773747897458027[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nRubbish!
We donâ€™t have time!
The Tanuki are surely closing in.

1773747897458027 -->|Tanuki?|1773747939191155[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nThe Tanuki Clan, raccoon-shaped yokai, have long feuded with the fox clan. 
They covet the fox transformation power. 
\nBut our clan always kept them at bay. Until they disappearedâ€¦]
1773747939191155 -->1773747965848950[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nNow, war!]

\nAh!]
1773747978007928 -->1773747994449274[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nYes, now the Tanuki clans are expanding their territories,
And fighting each other for control. 
And their minds turn to Seikyuâ€¦\nIf there is a source of the fox transformation power, it is here.
And the Tanuki want it.

1773748035614079 -->|We'll do our best!|1773748070053257[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Fox:</b>
\nWe're supposed to renovate the farm, help the locals, explore the ruins,
stop any tanuki, find the foxes, and learn how to shapeshiftâ€¦
all at the same time.\nSounds easy!]
