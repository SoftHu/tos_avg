1758884577814075 -->|I drink occasionally.|1758884671638081[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yohji:</b>

Have you noticed that large building under construction in town?
That will soon be a new casino.
A woman named Kababa approached me about opening it. 

Some yokai oppose the idea,
Saying Kababa is a dubious individual. 
But I invited her to Seikyu regardless.

1772873436073303 -->1772873466546521[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yohji:</b>

Kababa also has interest in the fox ruins.
She has offered to host several festivals in Seikyu 
to fund a survey of their depths. 

Powerful items are rumoured to be hidden within. 
I can only guess at what she hopes to findâ€¦
But for now, we have a common goal. 

I donâ€™t want Kababa or her people in the ruins though
Her money is vital to our endeavour,
But the ruins are sacred and dangerous. 

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;,
what we find there will undoubtably effect you the most. 
As a fox, I hope youâ€™ll join our effort.

1772873530297690 -->|The ruins are for foxes, not shifty bookmakers. |1772873572184416[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yohji:</b>

Wellâ€¦ Iâ€™m afraid the decision is already made. 
Kababa will open the casino 
And I will take full responsibility of our exploration.  

But to be joined by a foxâ€¦ the last foxesâ€¦
Would be an enormous benefit. 
I hope we can change your mind, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.
