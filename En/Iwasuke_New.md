The mask stall is a must-visit, they have many new designs this year. 
I'm thinking about giving one a try.]
Start -->1758175820284486[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's a rare opportunity, so relax and have fun. Enjoy the summer festival!]
Start -->1763923720742699[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You have to believe that every investment you make in me 
is worthwhile.
I'll get you good returns.]
Start -->1763923720742701[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You have great taste in gifts and friends alike.]
Start -->1763923720743727[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Thanks for taking care of me...
I won't forget you when I strike it rich.]
Start -->1763923720743729[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You know what?
This whole gift-giving thing is really a learning experience.]
Start -->1763923720743731[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

True, I'm a nobody here in Seikyu,
but that doesn't give you the right to bully me.]
Start -->1763923720744757[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I didn't really do birthdays before. But since coming to 
Seikyu, somehow I've started to enjoy every aspect of life.
Thank you for the gift!]
Start -->1763923720744759[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; even got me a birthday present.
I didn't know you cared more about me than my brothers. 
Thanks so much.]
Start -->1763923720745785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I didn't expect &lbrace;playername&rbrace; to remember my birthday...
I will never forget your kindness in times of trouble.]
Start -->1763923720745787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I really should be happy to receive a gift...]
Start -->1763923720746813[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Don't be a party pooper on my birthday, okay?]
Start -->1763923720746815[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Bye. Good luck.]
Start -->1763923720746817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Lady Luck will favor you.]
Start -->1763923720747843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'll see you later. Come talk to me when you're lonely.]
Start -->1768539478584064[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Hey! What are you gawking at?
Wanna fight?]
Start -->1768539478585090[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Stop staring at me.
You've got the wrong guy. I'm not Theo or Taji.]
Start -->1768539478586116[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Interested in a little gambling?
We can play anything you want. Your rules.]
Start -->1768539478586118[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

My big brother always advised me to be more down-to-earth.
No wonder he couldn't make Ryoko happy.]
Start -->1768539478587144[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

This heat...
Hey, can you buy me a soda?
No? Never mind then.]
Start -->1768539478588170[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You wanted to see me? Now that's rare...
So, what do you need? I don't work for nothing.]
Start -->1768539478589196[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

OK, I'm listening...
What are you trying to say?]
Start -->1768539478589198[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Would you look at that. 
I thought I didn't have much of a presence...
What are you trying to say?]
Start -->1768539478590224[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's you... Are you here to see me?
Or are you actually here for Theo or Taji?
It happens; after all, we all look alike.]
Start -->1768539478591250[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You're a gambler too, right? 
I can easily spot a fellow bettor in a crowd.]
Start -->1768539478591252[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Life is a gamble. 
Once you're at the table, there's no turning back.]
Start -->1768539478592278[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Any chance of getting rich?
Don't be petty, let me in on it!]
Start -->1768539478593304[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Greed is a vice, I don't deny that.
It will devour the souls of the weak and incompetent...
But for the strong, it can be a weapon of choice.]
Start -->1768539478593306[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

In the fall, people tend to have a few extra bucks 
in their pockets. This time of year, they're more loose 
when it comes to spending money.]
Start -->1768539478594332[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Taji was telling me all day yesterday how fun fishing was.
Catching a big fish with a small hook, 
sounds like a gamble to me.]
Start -->1768539478595358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'm just having a moment, I'm not frozen to death...]
Start -->1768539478597408[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You've become good friends with a lot of people in town...
Why not make me another?]
Start -->1768539478597410[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Granny Gambler is a shrewd businesswoman. Don't you agree? 
Luxurious casinos, beautiful songstresses, all a veneer...
The gold in the gamblers' pockets, that's what she's after.]
Start -->1768539478598436[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Why don't you buy me a drink?
It wouldn't hurt you ......]
Start -->1768539478599462[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The winter sun is like the light in a refrigerator...
All brightness, no heat.]
Start -->1768539478600488[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Are you here to supervise the work?
Don't worry, I will make good use of that secret book...
As for your reward, I think it will take a few more days.]
Start -->1768539478600490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

If I'm not mistaken, you're the only fox left on this island.
Wouldn't you consider retiring to a museum in your old age?]
Start -->1768539478601516[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's inevitable that Granny Gambler hasn't been 
looking so good lately.
Anytime I step in, it means she's gonna lose money.]
Start -->1768539478601518[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'm not much of a talker, but I'm definitely dependable.
You've been kind to my brothers and me, 
and I won't forget it.]
Start -->1768539478602544[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Would you like a refreshing milkshake?
Lemon? Strawberry? Vanilla?]
Start -->1768539478603570[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I've seen a strange man-eating plant at the casino...
It could talk!
Now that's creepy...]
Start -->1768539478604596[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Now I'm a big shot at the casino...
Feel free to drop my name. It'll do wonders!]
Start -->1768539478605622[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Happy to oblige!
Is there anything I can do to help?]
Start -->1768539478605624[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The Gambler King is more than a book about cheating.
It introduces fox traditions. For example, going to a shrine 
to make an offering before placing a bet to gain a blessing.]
Start -->1768539478607674[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Why don't we have a drink together someday?
Long time no chat, and I have so much gossip to share with you.]
Start -->1768539478607676[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Do you think Ms. Yoni likes flowers?
If I sent her a bouquet of roses, would she accept it?]
Start -->1768539478608702[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Do you know what a fall march is?
Seabert said he wants to organize a &quot;long fall march&quot;.
Does that mean we're going to war?]
Start -->1768539478608704[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's been a long time since you've come to see me. Forgotten about me?
Friendship needs to be maintained!]
Start -->1768539478609730[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

What do you say? Wanna place a bet?
Must be itching to play after all this time...]
Start -->1768539478610756[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Mushroom soup again... I hate mushroom soup!
Every fall there's an endless supply of mushroom soup!]
Start -->1768539478610758[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The cold winter clears the mind!
That's good for gamblers.]
Start -->1768539478611784[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Have a drink to warm up...
This winter is a tough one!
You won't be able to play cards with me if you catch a cold.]
Start -->1768539478612810[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Don't you find winter boring?
No one has anything to do and you just stay home all day...
Have you come to bring me some excitement today?]
Start -->1768539478613836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I hope spring comes soon!
I'm so tired of this barren world.
I should have moved to an island where it's nice all year round.]
Start -->1768539478614862[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I've already exceeded my winnings goal for the year!
Awesome!
Should I strive for even more next year?]
Start -->1768539498566480[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Damn, check out this spring weather!
It's a sight for sore eyes!
I just love it here...]
Start -->1768539498567506[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The sun is slowly turning me into a piece of jerky!
I should never have come to this dump in the first place!]
Start -->1768539498568532[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Ah-choo!
Autumn is peak flu season, and just my luck to catch it.]
Start -->1768539498568534[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Where's the summer sun when we need it?
Do we have to make do with this dim bulb all season?]
Start -->1768539498569560[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

A wonderful evening like this doesn't come around often.
I guess you wouldn't want to be disturbed, right?
I mean, if you have something to say, out with it.]
Start -->1768539498570586[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I was gonna make this proposition to the mayor. What do you think?
The community should provide unlimited cold sodas on hot summer days.]
Start -->1768539498571612[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

These autumn nights are getting chilly,
so you and Kon should put on a little extra clothing.
By the way, being foxes, do you grow a thicker coat of fur for winter?]
Start -->1768539498571614[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

A long and boring winter night...
Guess I'll hit the bar and maybe catch some interesting gossip.]
Start -->1768539498572640[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

There is no need for an umbrella in drizzle like this.]
Start -->1768539498572642[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Summer rainstorms are always accompanied by lightning and thunder,
quite frightening.]
Start -->1768539498573668[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's snowing. When I was a kid we would build secret bases with snow 
in the yard. Ah... certainly brings me back.]
Start -->1768539498574694[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It gets colder every time it rains in fall. 
It easy to get sick in weather like this.]
Start -->1768539498574696[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Catch the Carp Flag?
Doesn't sound like much fun, I'll just go play Black Jack.]
Start -->1768539498575722[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Bye. Enjoy.]
Start -->1768539498576748[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The three of us owe our happiness to you!
It's an honor to have met you...
I'm not just being polite; this is all from the heart.]
Start -->1768539498576750[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I guess we are what is commonly known as &quot;joined at the hip&quot;.
Uh... actually, I wanted to say that I really care about this friendship.
Let me do something for you, too.]
Start -->1768539498577776[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I opened an account for you at the casino with an emergency deposit.
The password is your birthday.
You'll need it someday.]
Start -->1768539498577778[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Have you seen my brothers?
It's so crowded in here. I'm a little worried about them.]
Start -->1768539498578804[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Excuse me, I've got something to attend to.]
Start -->1768539498579830[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Stay in touch, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
