It's a rare opportunity, so relax and have fun. Enjoy the summer festival!]
Start -->1763923720742699[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You have to believe that every investment you make in me is worth something.
I'll show you the return.]
Start -->1763923720742701[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You're very discerning!
Whether it's picking out a gift, or picking out a friend.]
Start -->1763923720743727[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Thanks for taking care of me ......
I won't forget you when I'm rich.]
Start -->1763923720743729[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You know what?
The truth is that the whole gift-giving thing is really a learning experience.]
Start -->1763923720743731[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Although I'm a nobody in Qing Lan ......
But I can't be bullied by you like this, right?]
Start -->1763923720744757[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Actually, I didn't even celebrate birthdays much before
But after coming to Green Lantern, somehow I actually started to enjoy every second of being alive too.
Thank you for the gift!]
Start -->1763923720744759[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace; And got me a birthday present.
I didn't realize you cared more about me than my brothers, thanks a lot.]
Start -->1763923720745785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I didn't expect &lbrace;playername&rbrace; to remember my birthday ......
I will never forget your kindness in times of trouble.]
Start -->1763923720745787[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I really should be happy to receive a gift ......]
Start -->1763923720746813[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Don't be a party pooper on my birthday, okay?]
Start -->1763923720746815[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Bye. Good luck.]
Start -->1763923720746817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Lady Luck will favor you.]
Start -->1763923720747843[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'll see you later. Come talk to me when you're lonely.]
Start -->1768539478584064[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Hello! What are you looking at?
Trying to pick a fight? ......]
Start -->1768539478585090[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Stop staring at me. ......
I think you've got the wrong person, I'm not Tiff or Taji.]
Start -->1768539478586116[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Interested in a couple of bets?
You set the rules, play whatever you want.]
Start -->1768539478586118[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Big brother always advised me that I should live a practical life ......
No wonder he couldn't give Ms. Ryoko happiness.]
Start -->1768539478587144[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's hot. ......
Hey, can you buy me a soda?
Ah, you can't? Then forget it.]
Start -->1768539478588170[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You asked for me? That's rare. ......
Go ahead, what's up? I don't work for nothing.]
Start -->1768539478589196[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Okay, I'm listening ......
What are you trying to say?]
Start -->1768539478589198[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

That's rare, I thought I didn't have much of a presence ......
What are you trying to say?]
Start -->1768539478590224[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's you ...... Are you here to see me?
Or are you actually here to see Tief or Taji ......
It's not unusual for the three of us to look so much alike that we're often mistaken for each other.]
Start -->1768539478591250[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You're a gambler too, right? ......
I can accurately find kindred spirits in a crowd.]
Start -->1768539478591252[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Life is a gamble, and once you're at the table there's no room for retreat.]
Start -->1768539478592278[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Any chance of getting rich?
Don't be cheap, tell me too!]
Start -->1768539478593304[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Greed is a vice, I don't deny that.
It will devour the souls of the weak and incompetent ......
But for the strong, greed is a weapon while it lasts.]
Start -->1768539478593306[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

In the fall, people become generous with their money.
At this time of year, they are a little more generous than usual when it comes to spending money.]
Start -->1768539478594332[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Tanoshi has been telling me all yesterday how fun fishing is.
Harvesting a big fish with a small bait is no different from gambling. ......]
Start -->1768539478595358[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'm just having a moment, I'm not freezing to death ......]
Start -->1768539478597408[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You've become good friends with a lot of people in town ......
Why don't you think about me?]
Start -->1768539478597410[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Granny Gambler is such a shrewd businesswoman. You think so too, don't you?
Luxurious casinos, beautiful songstresses, these are just appearances ......
The gold coins in the gamblers' pockets are her goal.]
Start -->1768539478598436[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Why don't you buy me a drink?
It wouldn't hurt you ......]
Start -->1768539478599462[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The winter sun is like a light in a refrigerator ......
It looks pretty bright but nothing warm.]
Start -->1768539478600488[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Are you here to supervise the work?
Don't worry, I will make good use of that secret book ......
As for giving you your reward, I think it will take a few more days.]
Start -->1768539478600490[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

If I'm not mistaken, you're the only foxes left on this island.
Wouldn't you consider going to a museum in your old age?]
Start -->1768539478601516[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's inevitable that Granny Gambler hasn't been looking so good lately.
Anytime I patronize, it means she's losing money.]
Start -->1768539478601518[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I'm not much of a talker, but I'm definitely dependable.
You've been kind to us brothers, and I won't forget this favor.]
Start -->1768539478602544[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Would you like a refreshing milkshake?
Lemon? Strawberry? Vanilla?]
Start -->1768539478603570[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I've seen a strange cannibalistic flower at a casino ......
It could even talk!
That's a bit creepy ......]
Start -->1768539478604596[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Now I'm a big shot in the casino ......
You can report my name later, it's very useful!]
Start -->1768539478605622[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Happy to oblige!
Is there anything I can do to help?]
Start -->1768539478605624[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

In fact, King of Thousand Kings introduces not only the art of Thousand Tricks, but also some of the traditions of the fox fairies.
For example, before going to the gambling table you must go to a shrine and make an offering of inari sushi
This way you can gain the blessing of the gods and get in touch with Him.]
Start -->1768539478607674[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Why don't we have a drink together some day?
It's been a long time since I've chatted with you. I have a lot of gossip I want to share with you.]
Start -->1768539478607676[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Do you think Ms. Yoni would like flowers?
If I send her a bouquet of roses, will she take them ......]
Start -->1768539478608702[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Do you know what &quot;hiking&quot; means?
Hypertherm says it wants to organize a &quot;fall hike.&quot; ......
Does that mean we're going shoe shopping?]
Start -->1768539478608704[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

You haven't come to chat with me for a long time. Have you forgotten me?
A good friendship needs to be maintained!]
Start -->1768539478609730[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

What do you say? You want to bet?
Must be itching to play after a long time ......]
Start -->1768539478610756[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Mushroom soup again ...... I hate mushroom soup!
Come fall there's an endless supply of mushroom soup!]
Start -->1768539478610758[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Cold winters clear our minds!
That's good for the gamblers.]
Start -->1768539478611784[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Have a drink to warm up ......
This winter is a tough one!
You won't be able to play cards with me happily if you catch a cold.]
Start -->1768539478612810[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Don't you think winter seems boring?
Everyone has nothing to do and stays inside all day ......
So you've come to offer me something new to enjoy today?]
Start -->1768539478613836[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I hope spring comes soon!
I'm so tired of this bare world.
I should have known I should have moved to an island with four seasons to live ......]
Start -->1768539478614862[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Exceeded the gambling target this year!
Awesome!
Should we build on it next year ......]
Start -->1768539498566480[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's fucking spring!
It's too beautiful to be true!
I just love it here ......]
Start -->1768539498567506[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

This ungodly sun is drying me out ......
I should never have chosen to come to this shithole in the first place!]
Start -->1768539498568532[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Ah ...... sneeze!
Fall is high flu season and I just accidentally caught it.]
Start -->1768539498568534[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Why don't we let the summer sun come out to work?
Do we have to deal with this flimsy glowing bulb all season?]
Start -->1768539498569560[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's a rare and wonderful evening, and you wouldn't want to be disturbed if you were, would you?
I mean, if you have something to say, just say so ......]
Start -->1768539498570586[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I was just about to propose this to the Lord Mayor, what do you think of this one?
The community should add benefits - unlimited cold sodas on hot summer days.]
Start -->1768539498571612[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The fall nights are already getting a little chilly, so I think both you and Fox Spike should put on a little extra clothing.
By the way, being foxes, do you guys change your fur before winter?]
Start -->1768539498571614[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

A long and boring winter night ......
Guess the only thing left to do is go around the tavern and maybe hear some interesting gossip.]
Start -->1768539498572640[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

There is absolutely no need for an umbrella in this light rain ......]
Start -->1768539498572642[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Summer rainstorms are always accompanied by lightning and thunder, which is oddly scary.]
Start -->1768539498573668[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

It's snowing, and when I was a kid we would build secret bases out of snow in the yard.
It's so nostalgic ......]
Start -->1768539498574694[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

A fall rain is a cold one, and it's easiest to get sick in this kind of weather.]
Start -->1768539498574696[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Brave the carp flag?
Doesn't sound like much fun, I'll just go play Black Jack.]
Start -->1768539498575722[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Bye. Enjoy.]
Start -->1768539498576748[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

The three of us brothers owe our happiness to you!
It's an honor to know you ......
This is not a polite conversation, this is all from my heart.]
Start -->1768539498576750[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

According to the book, our friendship could be considered &quot;axe to axe&quot;.
Uh, ...... actually, I was going to say that I really care about this friendship.
Let me do something for you, too.]
Start -->1768539498577776[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

I opened an account for you at the casino with an emergency deposit.
The password is your birthday ......
You'll need it someday.]
Start -->1768539498577778[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Have you seen my other two brothers?
It's a little crowded. I'm a little worried about them.]
Start -->1768539498578804[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

If you'll excuse me, I have some business.]
Start -->1768539498579830[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Ivan:</b>

Stay in touch, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
