\nâ€¦.
A queen sits before me: Sorrowful, powerful, splendid.
I can feel her heart.\nMistakes made, pleasures enjoyed, hope for the future.\nYou've done it.
You've put your soul on the canvas.
The queen is you, Liliana.]
1768792328505231 -->1768792455003024[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>
\nIâ€¦ Thank you.]
1768792455003024 -->1768792464139153[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nIt's your best work. 
You're finally painting for yourself.\nI'd like to hang it in the shrine permanently. 
Congratulations.]
1768792464139153 -->|It's perfect!|1768792520710041[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>

\nI used to think there was a flower bud within me.
For years I was waiting for it to bloomâ€¦  
Like the Ephemera or Peacock Cactus.\nI thought one day I'd be good enough, worthy enoughâ€¦
To have my one moment in the sun. 
But now I realizeâ€¦\nWe're all blooming every day. 
Every morning we open ourselves to this life
.\nAnd it's our duty to experience every moment, 
There is no perfect moment.\nThat's what I learned painting your blue mountain Peony. 
Actually, I wasn't thinking or hoping. I was justâ€¦ 
Painting.\nI let go of everything and just experienced the moment. 
I was inspired by youâ€¦ 
or maybe something elseâ€¦]
1768792609518508 -->|Inspired by friendship.|1768792704609202[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>
\nOf course. 
You've been such a good friend to me, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.
I'm so grateful for your support.\nNo matter how difficult or painful yesterday was,
As long as the sun rises and morning comes,
We can move forward again.\nWatching the sunriseâ€¦
One can't help but look forwardâ€¦
To want kind of day it will be today.]
1768792609518508 -->|Inspired by love.|1768792953770940[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>
\nYesâ€¦ that's it, isn't it?
It's been right in front of me, 
but I was too distracted to seeâ€¦\nLove makes even the most stubborn flower bloom.]

\nI've just had an idea for a new painting. 
Seikyu's sunrise is the most beautiful I've ever seen. 
The sun starts its journey from the darkest horizon.\nThen it crosses heaven little by little,
Casting the land in a million different hues, 
Giving energy to every aspect of life.\nBefore settling down again for the night. 
I will paint that whole odyssey, 
Sunrise and sunset in a single canvasâ€“an entire lifetime.\nBut such an ambitious painting would take monthsâ€¦
And would require a huge spaceâ€¦]
1768793673282495 -->|Use my house.|1768793781685193[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>
\nReally!? Ah, splendid!]
1768793673282495 -->|That will be a magnificent piece.|1768793911423946[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Liliana:</b>
\nI'll find space somewhere. 
And you must come to visit!\nYou're my muse now. 
You have responsibilities.]

\nNow, let's watch the sunrise.]
