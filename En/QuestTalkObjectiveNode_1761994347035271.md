\n... Actually, I already knew...
I'm sorry...
I should have told you.]

\nYohji noticed something was amiss in the ruins first.
As of now, only Torleone, Yohji, you, and I know.\nYohji asked me to put him in charge of this.
He and Torleone will keep the town safe.\nI'm willing to trust them.
If they're capable of handling this,
then there's no need to tell the residents.]
