\nI had a feeling while the earth was shaking. 
I could tell it was coming from the fox ruins. 
Bulls are Earth yokai, we have a special connection to the earth.
\nI couldn't help but think of the Gulubo's warning.
There's something in those ruinsâ€¦ 
And it's awake.

1772345977179267 -->|Yes, we will need its power.|1772346049252489[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Hephaestus:</b>
\nYes, we can leave nothing to chance. Let's pray we don't have to use it. 
\n Perhaps you're right. It should be a last resort.
