Greetings. You seem to be in a good mood today... If you need any assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
After all, serving everyone is my duty!]

Hello there. You seem pretty happy today... Has something good happened?
Ah! Sorry, I didn't mean to pry into your privacy. I always forget about boundaries.]

Farewell, then.]

Although I was elected as mayor... I know it's only because of my father's legacy that people accept me.
But I won't be disheartened! My father's legacy is his, and I will create my own.
Anyway, I'll work hard to gain everyone's approval. Please take care of me in the future.]

Speaking of which, are you interested in desserts? Kon told me you're great at cooking. I'd love to exchange ideas with you sometime.
Yes, I'm planning to build a baking school in the town. I'm promoting and recruiting on social media. The response has been surprisingly enthusiastic!
I'm not going to lie, I was pretty famous online. &quot;Oda's Baking Classroom&quot; is my personal channel, deeply trusted and loved by all.
When they heard I was opening an offline training school, fans enthusiastically signed up, far exceeding my expectations...]

I was planning to visit Miss Ama's shop! Musashi recently brought some fabric for me, and I've asked her to tailor some clothes for me.
Oh, the pattern on that fabric is so cute... Miss Ama said it's perfect for a fluffy skirt. Thinking about it makes me a little excited!]

Hey, nicely done!
Thanks a lotâ€¦]
Start -->1730233993072751[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

So polite...
I appreciate your generosity
and I really like what you gave meâ€¦]
Start -->1730233993072753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1730233993072755[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

This...
Ugh...]
Start -->1730233993073781[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1730233993073783[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace;... We're getting along well!]
Start -->1730233993073785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary... I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753123160870296[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, welcome to the Carp Festival. It's an important annual event in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;. Don't forget to join in the activities at &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;'s booth!]
Start -->1753123460401561[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Please make sure you have fun today!]
Start -->1757029480119432[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Good evening, nice to see you again. It looks like you have plans for tonight. Have fun!
Although Seikyu is very safe, don't come back too late... Safety first, after all!]
Start -->1757029824382093[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Please take care of me. I am Yui Oda, the mayor of the town. You can call me Yui; everyone does.
Although this may sound a bit self-satisfied, if you encounter any difficulties, you can come to me. My job is to help everyone solve problems.]
Start -->1730229309007977[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Did you know? Many years ago, Seikyu wasn't as quiet as it is now. Back then, it was home to foxes. The Oda family's friendship with the foxes began in ancient times.
The foxes protected Seikyu, and the Oda family protected the foxes. However, it seems something happened during my grandfather's generation. The foxes disappeared...
As a member of the Oda family, I still want to fulfill my duty, protecting this land and waiting for the foxes to return.]
Start -->1757037204773016[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Do you know Teru Teru Bozu? In the past, when the foxes were still around, they would often make Teru Teru Bozu and hang them under the eaves.
It's said that Teru Teru Bozu can be used to pray for good weather. However, since they disappeared, this tradition seems to have been forgotten.]
Start -->1757037426456730[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Do you know the legend of the fox wedding? The foxes would hold wedding ceremonies on rainy days like today. The brides would wear white kimonos and ride in palanquins to distant places.
It's said that when encountering a fox wedding, people should avoid it.]

Good evening... Actually, I'm not good at drinking, but I really want to chat with everyone.
My aunt makes special non-alcoholic drinks for me, like ginger ale and raspberry juice... Mainly for the sake of participation.]
Start -->1757990030330425[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

The lights and wine... Urban love stories often start this way. Don't you think it's romantic for two strangers to meet and fall in love?]
Start -->1757990760116796[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

The other day, out of curiosity, I tried my aunt's new brew. It tasted like sweet juice, but when I regained consciousness, it was already the next afternoon.
What kind of magical tool accelerates the passage of time?!]
Start -->1758097679938149[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Seikyu is getting more and more lively; I should be happy, but is the construction of the casino really a good thing? I often worry that it might get out of control.]
Start -->1758100491311719[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

The long night needs some entertainment. Have fun, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1758249243877977[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui Oda:</b>

Welcome to the Summer Festival! I'm inexperienced in hosting large events, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know...]
