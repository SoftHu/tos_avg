\nWhile the sun adorns the sky I am but a humble servent of Seikyu.]

\nSeikyu is simply stunning at night... there is nothing that quite compares!]

\nA gift from you makes my day a little bit brighter, thank you!]
Start -->1775166031624245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nIt truly is kind of you to have remembered my birthday, but a gift is far too generous.]
Start -->1775166031624247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI tend not to see much merit in celebrating my birthday but thank you for the gesture.]
Start -->1775166031625275[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI did not think you would remember given how busy you have been. You really know the way to my heart... this is perfect!]
Start -->1775166218007617[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI'm sure you and Kon need to get back to the farm, I shall not keep you!]

\nI've some time today and will be baking some goodies. Do pop by to try some if you can!]
Start -->1775166486298698[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
