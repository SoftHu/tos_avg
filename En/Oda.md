\nFarewell. If you need me simply speak my name.]
Start -->1730217216536675[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI shall take my leave now, I'm sure you and Kon are busy!]
Start -->1730233993071725[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nFor me? Are you sure? The time you must have taken out of your already busy schedule to source this for me... how can I ever repay you?]
Start -->1730233993072751[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nHow did you know I liked this? Your attention to detail and care is far more than I deserve! Thank you!]
Start -->1730233993072753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nYou two are far too kind!]
Start -->1730233993072755[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThis is a fine item, but I am not sure what use I would have for it!]
Start -->1730233993073781[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nMy time is limited here so I'll be blunt with you! I am not sure what made you think of me when you obtained this.]
Start -->1730233993073783[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI'm feeling closer to Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1730233993073785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ player:</b>
\nI did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753123160870296[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nWelcome to your first Carp Festival &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;! You too Kon!]
Start -->1753123460401561[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI do hope you two had fun today!]
Start -->1757989735854647[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nGood evening... 
I barely drink but I really want to chat with everyone.\nMy aunt makes special non-alcoholic drinks for me,
like ginger ale and raspberry juice...
Just so I have something to sip on.]
Start -->1757990030330425[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThe shifting lights, the glistening wineglasses...
Setting the scene for a love story.
Isn't it romantic when two strangers fall in love?]
Start -->1757990760116796[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThe other day, I tried my aunt's new brew.
It tasted as sweet as fruit juice, but when I woke up,
it was already the next afternoon.\nIs this some magical trinket that accelerates time?!]
Start -->1758097679938149[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nSeikyu is now a bustling town; I should be happy,
but is having a casino really a good thing?
I often worry things would spin out of control.]

\nWelcome to the Summer Festival!
I'm no expert on hosting big events,
so if you have any suggestions, please let me know...]
Start -->1758249694724699[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nYou don't see a festival like this every day,
so try to have as much fun as possible!]
Start -->1769153395688482[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>

\nAs much as I would like to stay here and admire the cherry blossoms, there is simply too much work to be done!]
Start -->1775163103296538[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThe weekend draws ever closer to to its end... is everyone ready for another bustling week in Seikyu?]
Start -->1775163107154971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nWhere did the first half of the week go Miss Ama? There is still so much to do!]
Start -->1775164372485149[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nOh, well you know what they say - Work hard, Play hard. Right?]
Start -->1775164416326688[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nNow that warmer days are on the horizon I think it's time for the you-know-what Shuten!]
Start -->1775164420689953[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI sometimes find myself staring into this fountain getting lost in my thoughts. Does that happen to you?]
Start -->1775164711722024[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nWhile the sun adornes the sky I am but a humble servent of Seikyu.]
Start -->1775164732277801[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nSeikyu is simply stunning at night... there is nothing that quite compares!]
Start -->1775164532912166[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThis weather puts a dampener on my productivity... how annoying!]
Start -->1775166031622193[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nA Birthday present, for me? How did you know? This, what a gift!]
Start -->1775166031623219[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nA gift from you makes my day a little bit brighter, thank you!]
Start -->1775166031624245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nIt truly is kind of you to have remembered my Birthday, but a gift is far too generous.]
Start -->1775166031624247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThis is a fine item, but I am not sure what use I would have for it!]
Start -->1775166031625275[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI did not think you would remember given how busy you have been. You really know the way to my heart... this is perfect!]
Start -->1775166218007617[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI'm sure you and Kon need to get back to the farm, I shall not keep you!]
Start -->1775166226185284[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nAs much as this line of inquiry fascinates me, my duty to Seikyu summons me away!]
Start -->1775166218007618[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI have some free time later on and have baked some good that I would love to get your opinion on!  Pop by if you can!]
Start -->1775166486298698[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nDid you see the Koinobori I hung outside the farm? Kon mentioned you didn't have one so I stayed up last night making it!]
Start -->1775166486299724[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nEverything went according to plan, what a relief! Now how about we go and relax?]
Start -->1775166589369426[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThere is nothing I would rather be doing in this warm weather than helping out my townsfolk!]
Start -->1775166628730970[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nThese amber leaves signal the coming of colder months. I must make sure everything is prepared for winter!]
Start -->1775166633910364[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nIt is chilly out today. Remember to wrap up warm, alright?]
Start -->1775166811015263[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI am forever grateful to Shuten for looking out for the residents of Seikyu and being the holder of their secrets. She is my most trusted ally!]
Start -->1775166820796512[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nIt has always saddened me that we could never restore the fox shrines to the way they once were. However, since you have come to Seikyu they've looked a lot better!]
Start -->1775172156249857[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nMay your first Christmas with us be a merry one &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;!]
Start -->1775172164922114[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI'm glad to see you've both settled in so well! Here's to many more festive celebrations.]
Start -->1775172166556419[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nMerry Christmas! I had to stop myself from coming over to the farm this morning, but I baked you this!]
Start -->1775172173178628[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Oda:</b>
\nI must rush off now, people to see, places to be. But, you should pop over later, I'll make some time for you!]
