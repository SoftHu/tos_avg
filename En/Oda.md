Greetings. I see you're in high spirits today...
If you need any help, don't hesitate to reach out!
After all, it's my duty to serve!]
Start -->1730213165787229[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

How's it going?
You seem to be in a great mood today...
Got any good news?
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
I'm not always good with boundaries.]
Start -->1730217004590177[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Farewell, then.]
Start -->1730217216536675[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Okay, see you soon then.]

Even though I was elected as mayor...
I know it's only due to my father's legacy
that people accept me.
But I won't be disheartened!
My father's legacy is his,
and I will create my own.
Anyway, I'll work hard to gain everyone's acceptance.
Any help would be appreciated.]

Say, are you interested in desserts?
Kon told me you're quite the cook.
I'd love to exchange ideas with you sometime.
Yes, I'm planning to build a baking school.
I've been promoting and recruiting on social media.
I'm getting a ton of responses and it's so surprising!
Not going to lie, I was somewhat of a celeb online.
My channel is called &quot;Oda's Baking Class&quot;.
It's trusted and loved by all.
When my fans heard I was starting a school offline,
they signed up immediately and it was
far more popular than I thought it would be...]

I was just about to visit Miss Ama's store!
Musashi brought some fabric from outside recently,
and I've asked her to make a few dresses for me.
Oh, the print on that fabric is so cute...
Miss Ama said it'd be perfect for a pettiskirt.
I'm tingling with excitement!]
Start -->1730233993071725[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Hey, nicely done!
Thanks a lotâ€¦]
Start -->1730233993072751[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

You're too kind...
I appreciate your generosity
and I really like what you gave meâ€¦]
Start -->1730233993072753[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1730233993072755[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

This...
Ugh...]
Start -->1730233993073781[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1730233993073783[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1730233993073785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753123160870296[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

&lbrace;playername&rbrace;, welcome to the Carp Festival.
It's a big day in &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; every year.
Don't forget to join the fun at &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace;'s booth!]
Start -->1753123460401561[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Please, have the time of your life today!]
Start -->1757029480119432[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Good evening, nice to see you again.
Looks like you have plans for tonight. Have fun!
Seikyu is known for being a safe town,
but still, don't go home too late...
Safety first!]
Start -->1757029824382093[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

How do you do? I am Yui Oda, mayor of the town.
You can call me Yui; everyone does.
This may sound like bragging, but feel free to
come to me if you run into any problem.
After all, I'm here to help.]
Start -->1730229309007977[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

You know, many years ago, Seikyu wasn't this quiet.
Back then, it was home to the foxes.
The Odas and the foxes, we go way back.
They protected Seikyu, and the Odas protected them.
Then something happened in my grandpa's generation.
All the foxes vanished...
As an Oda myself, I want to fulfill my duty,
guarding this land and waiting for the foxes' return.]
Start -->1757037204773016[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Ever heard of the Teru Teru Bozu? In the past,
when the foxes were still around, they would make
these dolls and hang them under the eaves.
They used them to pray for good weather.
However, since the foxes were gone,
this tradition has been all but forgotten.]
Start -->1757037426456730[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Are you familiar with the Fox's Wedding?
In folklore, the foxes hold weddings on rainy days.
The brides wore white kimonos and rode in litters.
It's said that people should steer away from
the wedding when they see one.]
Start -->1757989735854647[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Good evening... 
I barely drink but I really want to chat with everyone.
My aunt makes special non-alcoholic drinks for me,
like ginger ale and raspberry juice...
Just so I have something to sip on.]
Start -->1757990030330425[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

The shifting lights, the glistening wineglasses...
Setting the scene for a love story.
Isn't it romantic when two strangers fall in love?]
Start -->1757990760116796[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

The other day, I tried my aunt's new brew.
It tasted as sweet as fruit juice, but when I woke up,
it was already the next afternoon.
Is this some magical trinket that accelerates time?!]
Start -->1758097679938149[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Seikyu is now a bustling town; I should be happy,
but is having a casino really a good thing?
I often worry things would spin out of control.]
Start -->1758100491311719[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

The night is long and entertainment is needed.
Have a great time, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1758249243877977[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

Welcome to the Summer Festival!
I'm no expert on hosting big events,
so if you have any suggestions, please let me know...]
Start -->1758249694724699[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Yui:</b>

You don't see a festival like this every day,
so try to have as much fun as possible!]
