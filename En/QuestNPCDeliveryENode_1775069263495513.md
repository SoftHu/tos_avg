\nItâ€™s too late to throw â€˜em back!
Iâ€™ll be here when youâ€™re ready to sell.
But I wonâ€™t take â€˜em if theyâ€™ve gone bad!]
1775069884284285 -->1775069988052363[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nAye, not a bad haul for a first-timer!
Hereâ€™s your reward.]

\nAye, there isnâ€™t enough for me. 
Remember, I need 4 &lbrace;item.42002&rbrace;.\nYou just need a little patience
and youâ€™ll have â€˜em in no time.\nIâ€™ll be here!]

\nDid we keep any fish for ourselves?]
1775522918356338 -->1775523012191605[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIf you did, youâ€™ll find that they are tasty!\nRemember, different fish live in different waters.
Sea fish, lake fish, river fishâ€¦ all different!
And they have seasons too, so always keep exploring.\nIâ€™ll pay top dollar for rare delicacies. 
And double if you catch something bigger than &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;!
â€¦ damn cat.\nNow go crazy.
But just donâ€™t hook yourselfâ€¦ or &lbrace;npc.4101&rbrace;!]
