\nIf you did, youâ€™ll find that they are tasty!\nRemember, different fish live in different waters.
Sea fish, lake fish, river fishâ€¦ all different!
And they have seasons too, so always keep exploring.\nIâ€™ll pay top dollar for rare delicacies. 
And double if you catch something bigger than Musashi!
â€¦ damn cat.\nNow go crazy.
But just donâ€™t hook yourselfâ€¦ or Kon!]
