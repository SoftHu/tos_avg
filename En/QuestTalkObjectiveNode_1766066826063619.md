As you know,
most man-eating plants don't talk.
That's why the yokai call me the cursed one.
With more and more yokai plotting against me,
I began to worry that I wouldn't be able to protect Hara.
One day.
I met a black fox.
He promised to take me and my child to a place 
where we wouldn't be disturbed.
And that's how we came to be here.]

In exchange, he took one of my leaves.
Now I have only one left.

With my leaf in his possession,
he could use its power to control me.
But I'm weak.
Controlling me probably wouldn't be much help.]
