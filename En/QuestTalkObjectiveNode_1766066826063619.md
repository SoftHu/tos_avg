\nAs you know,
most man-eating plants don't talk.\nThat's why the yokai call me the cursed one.\nWith more and more yokai plotting against me,
I began to worry that I wouldn't be able to protect Hara.\nOne day.
I met a black fox.\nHe promised to take me and my child to a place 
where we wouldn't be disturbed.
And that's how we came to be here.]
1766067230958349 -->|It can't be that simple.|1766067445982995[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ NiNi:</b>
\nIn exchange, he took one of my leaves.
Now I have only one left.

\nWith my leaf in his possession,
he could use its power to control me.\nBut I'm weak.
Controlling me probably wouldn't be much help.]
