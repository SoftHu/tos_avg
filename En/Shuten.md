Welcome... Burp...]
Start -->1727383481015421[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

What would you like a drink?
Burp... I'm already sipping away, latecomer.
I'm in a good mood. I'll serve you something special.]
Start -->1727383481016453[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

No drinking for minors, okay?
Haha, just kidding. I know you're an adult.
Well, blame it on your baby face.]
Start -->1727383481017481[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Good morning. We're not open yet...
Have you got nothing to do in the middle of the day?]
Start -->1727383481017483[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Would you like me to serve you today?
You'll need to pay extra.]
Start -->1727384006804621[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Be sure to come again...]
Start -->1727384181215375[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Sake is great, but other liquors are worth tasting too.
It's like love, sticking to only one kind is a bit...
Wanna hear more? There's a price for it.]

Seikyu's climate is perfect for growing rice,
but not for growing Nebbiolo for winemaking.
The monsoon keeps the shipping routes clear.
Without it, the island's visitors
wouldn't be able to enjoy the goods.]
Start -->1727384181216403[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Ever since we opened, we've been 
frequented by some... let's say... troublesome guests.
When that happens, I make them a Sweet Dreams
or a Slumber Fist. Wipes their memories clean
before they wake up.]
Start -->1727384181217429[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

After two or three drinks, guests open up.
They're saying stuff willingly, but I don't
want to pry into their private lives.
I only care about those I choose to care about.
So if you need someone to talk to...
Don't be shy, I'm all ears.]
Start -->1727384181217431[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Bars outside the island are offering full meals lately.
I'm debating whether I should follow the trend.
Now we offer basic dishes, but to serve full meals
we'd need to hire a chef. It's not about the money,
but about finding the right person.
How about working part-time here?
Heh, just kidding...]
Start -->1727389726958695[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4208&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753046481042233[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's the Carp Festival. The kids are having a blast.
Don't you want to join the fun, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;?
It's not like it happens every day.]
Start -->1753046656492346[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Make sure to enjoy yourself!]
Start -->1757099370372258[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Sweet pea, something troubling you?
You can talk to me.
I'm very good at soothing the mind.]
Start -->1757102886965417[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Such a beautiful day.
Ritsuryo and Kinntarou went out a while ago...
Youth is so wonderful, don't you think?]
Start -->1757103024217260[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

It's raining but I feel business will be good.
People get pretty down on a day like this.
I don't blame them if they want a drink or two.]
Start -->1757999745494602[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I heard in the past the foxes would drink 
&quot;Kitsune Sake&quot; at festivals. It's a specially made
sake usually stored in deep underground cellars.
Although their kind has disappeared,
I always feel like their special sake is still 
hidden somewhere underground...]
Start -->1758001805515340[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I don't like customers with poor drinking manners.
I charge them double for their drinks.
The bill sobers them up sharpish.]
Start -->1758002576105038[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The customers didn't make any requests,
but I've been meaning to diversify the drinks menu.
Sake, sparkling wine, sherry, whisky... you name it.]
Start -->1758164032445041[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Last time I came here,
I lost pawned everything I could...
Gives me the creeps to this day.]
Start -->1758164106621555[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Managing the bar can be so stressful.
I don't get to have much free time,
so I might as well play a few rounds...]
Start -->1758255376616042[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

How fun can a festival be without good wine?
Care to have a drink or two with me?]
Start -->1758256348074604[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Bye-bye...]
Start -->1763212958115530[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Little one, has anyone ever told you that you are most attractive when you are bold and generous?
This gift, my sister loves it ......]
Start -->1763212958115532[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Don't you want to cheer up your sister today? Little one.
Luckily I received your gift, the whole day's gloom has dissipated ......]
Start -->1763212958116558[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Although it's just a small token of appreciation ......
I'm still glad to see that you have me in your heart at all times.]
Start -->1763212958116560[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to prepare a gift for me ......
But did you confuse the gift for me with someone else's?]
Start -->1763212958117586[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Isn't it a bit rude to dismiss an elegant lady with such a gift?]
Start -->1763212958117588[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Every birthday day, my friends will prepare gifts for me, originally I have been accustomed to it.
But since I met you, I still can't help but look forward to ......
What would you give me if it were you.]
Start -->1763212958118614[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

So thoughtful, you even prepared a birthday gift for your sister ......
Why don't you give yourself to me?
Oh, just kidding, don't be nervous.]
Start -->1763212958118616[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Birthday gift?
I'm happy you got me a present though ......
If only I'd gone a little further.]
Start -->1763212958118618[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Actually I don't care what you send me ......
As long as you come to drink with me often, it's enough.]
Start -->1763212958119644[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Is it a little tantrum to give me a birthday present like this?
Is it because I haven't been paying enough attention to you lately that I've made you jealous?]
Start -->1763212958119646[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Don't forget to meet me for a drink when you have time, little man.]
Start -->1763212958120672[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

See you later, little man.]
Start -->1763212958120674[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

So, goodbye ......]
