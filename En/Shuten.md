Welcome... Burp...]

None]

Minors are not allowed drink, okay?
Ahaha, just kidding. I know you're an adult.
Who'd have guessed it though with your baby face?]
Start -->1727383481017481[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Good morning. We're not open yet...
Are you really wandering around with nothing to do in the middle of the day?]
Start -->1727383481017483[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Do you need personal hospitality today? There's an extra charge for that.]
Start -->1727384006804621[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Be sure to come againâ€¦]
Start -->1727384181215375[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Sake is great,
but local spirits from elsewhere boast unique flavours too.
Just like love, sticking to only one kind is a bitâ€¦]

Seikyu's climate is perfect for growing rice,
but not for growing Nebbiolo for winemaking.
The monsoon winds at sea keep
the shipping routes clear. Without them, the island's
visitors wouldn't be able to enjoy the goods.]
Start -->1727384181216403[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Ever since we opened, we've been frequented by some...
let's say... troublesome guests.
When that happens, I give them a 'Sweet Dreams'
or a 'Sleeping Fist'. They don't remember
anything when they wake up.]
Start -->1727384181217429[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

After two or three drinks, guests open up.
Although they say things themselves, I don't want
to pry into their private lives.
I only care about those I choose to care about.
So if you need someone to talk to...
don't be shy, I'm all ears.]

Bars outside are offering full meals lately.
I'm considering following the trend.
Now we offer basic dishes, but to serve
full meals, we'd need to hire a chef. It's not
about the money, but about finding the right chef.
How about working part-time here?
Heh, just kidding...]
Start -->1727389726956635[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727389726957661[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727389726957663[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727389726957665[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727389726957667[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727389726958693[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4208&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727389726958695[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4208&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753046481042233[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

The Carp Festival is here. Aren't the kids having a blast?
Don't you want to join in, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;?
It's a rare opportunity, after all.]
Start -->1753046656492346[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Make sure to enjoy yourself!]
Start -->1757099370372258[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Little one, is there something on your mind? You can talk to me. I'm very good at soothing your soul~]
Start -->1757102886965417[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

The weather is nice today. Ritsuryo and Kinntarou, those two little guys, went out to play early... Youth is so wonderful, don't you think?]
Start -->1757103024217260[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Even though it's a rainy day, I have a feeling business will be good. In this kind of weather, people's moods tend to be melancholic, and having a drink or two becomes a natural choice.]

I heard that in the past, the Kitsune tribe would drink &quot;Kitsune Sake&quot; at festivals. It was a special wine brewed from unique ingredients, usually stored in deep underground cellars.
Although the Kitsune tribe has disappeared, I always feel that Kitsune Sake is still hidden somewhere underground...]

Customers with poor drinking manners are not welcome here. I'll charge them double for their drinks. The bill will sober them up immediately.]
Start -->1758002576105038[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Although the customers don't have any particular opinions, I've been thinking of diversifying the drink menu lately. Sake, sparkling wine, sherry, whisky... we shouldn't miss any.]
Start -->1758164032445041[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

The last time I came here, I lost everything I could pawn... Thinking about it still scares me a bit.]

Running the shop every day builds up a lot of stress. It's rare to have some free time, so I might as well play a few rounds...]
Start -->1758255376616042[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

How can a joyful festival be without good wine? Want to have a drink or two with me?]
Start -->1758256348074604[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Shuten:</b>

Bye-bye...]
