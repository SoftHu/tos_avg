See ya later!]

What do you want? I'm busy!]
Start -->1727647926576245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I'm working multiple jobs to save some moneyâ€¦
If only I could open a shop in town,
get a little business going.
My childhood sweetheart is still waiting for me!
It's been so long since we last spoke...
I wonder how she's doing...]
Start -->1727647926576247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

A nobody yokai like me doesn't aspire to greatness.
All I want is a place to live a peaceful life.
Some of the guys from my village went out to
try and make living, only to wind up dead at sea...
How terrifying is that!
My sailing days are over, no more.
I'll be a land dweller for the rest of my life!]
Start -->1727648128856185[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727648128856187[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727648128857213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727648128857215[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727648128857217[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727648128858243[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4214&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727648128858245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4214&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753056426810768[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

No use chatting with me now...
After all, it's the annual Carp Festival.
Enjoy it while you can!]
Start -->1753056438301073[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Take it easy, have fun!]
Start -->1758256443454062[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Oh? The festival is in full swing and you're here
chit-chatting with me?]
Start -->1758256599193200[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

That's the spirit, youngster.
You've got to carpe that diem...]
