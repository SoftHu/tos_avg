See ya later!]
Start -->1727647787373683[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

What do you want? I'm busy!]
Start -->1727647926576245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm working multiple jobs to save some money...
If only I could open a shop in town,
get a little business going.
My childhood sweetheart is still waiting for me!
It's been so long since we last spoke...
I wonder how she's doing...]
Start -->1727647926576247[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

A nobody yokai like me doesn't aspire to greatness.
All I want is a place to live a peaceful life.
Some of the guys from my village went out to
try and make living, only to wind up dead at sea...
How terrifying is that!
My sailing days are over, no more.
I'll be a land dweller for the rest of my life!]
Start -->1727648128856185[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727648128856187[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727648128857213[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727648128857215[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727648128857217[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727648128858243[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4214&rbrace;...
We're going to get along!]
Start -->1727648128858245[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4214&rbrace;!]
Start -->1753056426810768[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

No use chatting with me now...
After all, it's the annual Carp Festival.
Enjoy it while you can!]
Start -->1753056438301073[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Take it easy, have fun!]
Start -->1758256443454062[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh? The festival is in full swing and you're here
chit-chatting with me?]
Start -->1758256599193200[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

That's the spirit, youngster.
You've got to carpe that diem...]
Start -->1763847060593429[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

You are generous and kind ......
You know that in this day and age, kindness is an expensive luxury.
But fortunately, you are rich in this area.]
Start -->1763847060593427[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Are you this gentle with everyone?
I'm really lucky to have met a friend like you.]
Start -->1763847060592401[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Life is supposed to be the best gift of all, isn't it?
Not that I want to be a spoilsport. Thank you for the gift.]
Start -->1763847060594455[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

As the saying goes--
Hey? What's the saying? ......
Anyway, you don't have to do anything extra!]
Start -->1763847060594457[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

If that's how you want to get my attention ......
Then you're making a fool of yourself.]
Start -->1763847060594459[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Every time I get to this day, I think about ......
What exactly do we exist in this world for?
It seems that it is to be able to receive a gift from you!]
Start -->1763847060595485[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

A gift to be remembered!
Not from heaven or from loved ones ......
But from you, my friend.]
Start -->1763847060595487[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I thought I would only get two gifts today ......
One more is earned!]
Start -->1763847060596513[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I didn't expect ...... to botch it!
I won't laugh at you.]
Start -->1763847060596515[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Do you know what the most important thing to do with people is?
Reading the air is also!
Looks like you need to work on that.]
Start -->1763847060596517[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

Goodbye ......]
Start -->1763847060597543[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

You don't have to waste your time on me.]
Start -->1763847060597545[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Tommy:</b>

I'll see you later, although you probably don't want to see me.]
