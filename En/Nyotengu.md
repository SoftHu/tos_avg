See youâ€¦]
Start -->1727666100083841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Oh, itâ€™s you... What do you want? Donâ€™t waste the precious morning hours chitchatting with me. Do something worthwhile.]
Start -->1727666100084867[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Trouble finding you, little fox? As long as youâ€™re one of us from &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;, I'm bound to protect you.
Itâ€™s an old pact between the Tengu clan and the fox spirits. Even though the foxes mysteriously disappeared, a Tengu's promise is gold.]
Start -->1727666206999689[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Are you the type that naturally attracts trouble? I have a feeling you and I are cut from the same cloth.
For little yokai seeking refuge, &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; is undoubtedly a paradise. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with liking peace.
But peace means boredom, means everythingâ€™s the same. Iâ€™m nearly suffocating from the boredom here.]
Start -->1727666207000717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Shuten... she's a big mouth.
And yet so perceptive. Nothing escapes her.
Don't say I didn't warn you:
don't go drinking with that guy!
Once you're drunk, secrets spill out.
Once Shuten knows,
your secrets won't be secrets anymore.]
Start -->1727667152884881[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
Can I really accept something so nice?]
Start -->1727667152884883[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Thank you!
I really love the gift you gave me...]
Start -->1727667152885909[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727667152885911[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, receiving it
makes me a bit uneasy...]
Start -->1727667152885913[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727667152886939[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4104&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727667152886941[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

I did something unnecessary...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4104&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753045593933621[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

In times like these, as guardians of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;,
we must be more vigilant...
Many dangers strike when they're least expected.]
Start -->1753045597110070[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Be extra careful, and don't relax too much.]
Start -->1757105373438130[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

The Tengu clan has delicate relationships with many other races. We donâ€™t choose our friends based on their power.]
Start -->1757105585625269[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

The strong are always drawn to danger, only by getting close to it can they understand their own place.
The Tengu clan never fears gazing into the abyss. Weâ€™re companions to the abyss... maybe we are the abyss itself.]
Start -->1757105882885305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; is always humble and respectful. Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m not complimenting her. I can't stand all the formalities.
Spending time on all that polite talk? Better to get straight to the point.
But seeing how cute she looks when she smiles, I'll forgive her anyway.]
Start -->1757106032150716[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Even though I patrol the mountains daily, I might miss something.
Better not roam around too late, or you might accidentally get taken out by me.
If I accidentally take you down as a suspicious person, that wouldnâ€™t be good.]
Start -->1757106180782271[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

The UV rays are really bad for the skin in this weather. I always have to slather on tons of sunscreen before I feel safe going out. Especially once I start flying, itâ€™s even easier to get sunburned.]
Start -->1757106398857410[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Flying in the rain really tests your skills, what with lightning interference and reduced visibility. But for a Tengu, itâ€™s all part of the training.]
Start -->1757988214146609[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Surprised to see me here? Is it strange that even a guardian of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; needs some fun?]
Start -->1757988520720947[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

That guy &lbrace;npc.4208&rbrace;, no sense of professionalism at all... My good sake in the shop is disappearing at an alarming rate.
Heâ€™s sneaking drinks of my stash! Asked him and he flat out denies it. If it weren't for our long friendship, Iâ€™d definitely teach him a lesson.]
Start -->1757989263913525[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Our Tengu doctrines explicitly state, &quot;Do not indulge in drink, do not indulge in pleasures.&quot; But how do you define indulging?
As long as you donâ€™t get drunk, right?]
Start -->1758090784538209[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

&quot;All in&quot; is a do-or-die attitude! If you believe deep inside that this time you can turn it around, you can do it.
This is a gambling tip passed down from an elder in the Tengu tribe. Mind you, this elder often ends up broke because of it. So, itâ€™s not very reliable.]
Start -->1758091192677987[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Our Tengu clan has a unique skill. Just one look and I know your fortune.
I see youâ€™re not having good luck today. Maybe donâ€™t put too much money on the table, huh?]
Start -->1758185326111317[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

The mayor gave me the day off today, said even if the sky falls, she doesnâ€™t need my help. Guess Iâ€™m playing tourist then.]
Start -->1758248674655831[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Enjoy it... little fox.]
