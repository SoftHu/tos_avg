See youâ€¦]
Start -->1727666100083841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh, it's you... What do you want? Don't waste the precious morning hours chitchatting with me. Do something worthwhile.]
Start -->1727666100084867[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Trouble finding you, little fox? As long as you're one of us from &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;, I'm bound to protect you.
It's an old pact between the Tengu clan and the foxes. Even though the foxes vanished, a Tengu's promise is gold.]
Start -->1727666206999689[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you the type that attracts trouble? I have a feeling you and I are cut from the same cloth.
For little yokai seeking refuge, &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; is undoubtedly a paradise. There's nothing wrong with liking peace.
But peace means boredom, means a routine existence. I'm nearly suffocating from the boredom here.]
Start -->1727666207000717[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Shuten... she's a big mouth.
And yet so perceptive. Nothing escapes her.
Don't say I didn't warn you:
don't go drinking with that guy!
Once you're drunk, secrets spill out.
Once Shuten knows,
your secrets won't be secrets anymore.]
Start -->1727667152884881[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Oh! How thoughtful...
But I'm not so sure I can accept something so nice.]
Start -->1727667152884883[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you!
I love it...]
Start -->1727667152885909[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Thank you...
We don't need to be so formal with each other.]
Start -->1727667152885911[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Although I appreciate the gift, accepting it
would make me uncomfortable...]
Start -->1727667152885913[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Are you intentionally trying to embarrass me?]
Start -->1727667152886939[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

I'm feeling closer to &lbrace;npc.4104&rbrace;...
We're getting along well!]
Start -->1727667152886941[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

I did something I shouldn't have...
I'm feeling distant from &lbrace;npc.4104&rbrace; now!]
Start -->1753045593933621[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

In times like these, as guardians of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace;,
we must be more vigilant...
Many dangers strike when they're least expected.]
Start -->1753045597110070[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Be extra vigilant, don't be complacent.]
Start -->1757105373438130[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The Tengu clan has delicate relationships with many other races. We don't choose our friends based on their power.]
Start -->1757105585625269[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The strong are always drawn to danger, only by getting close to it can they truly understand their place in the world.
The Tengu clan never fears gazing into the abyss. We're companions of the abyss... maybe we are the abyss itself.]
Start -->1757105882885305[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Mayor &lbrace;npc.4209.last_name&rbrace; is always humble and respectful. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complimenting her. I can't stand all the formalities.
Spending time on all that polite talk? Better to &quot;cut&quot; straight to the point.
But seeing how cute she looks when she smiles, I'll forgive her shortcomings.]
Start -->1757106032150716[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Even though I patrol the mountains daily, I'm bound to miss some things.
You'd better not roam around too late, 
to make sure you avoid any little accidents.
If I took you out that wouldn't be ideal for either of us.]
Start -->1757106180782271[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The UV rays are really bad for the skin in this weather. I always have to slather on tons of sunscreen before I feel safe going out. Especially once I start flying, it's even easier to get sunburned.]
Start -->1757106398857410[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Flying in the rain really tests your skills, what with lightning interference and reduced visibility. But for a Tengu, it's all part of the training.]
Start -->1757988214146609[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Surprised to see me here? It should be no surprise that even a guardian of &lbrace;location.13&rbrace; needs to let her hair down sometimes.]
Start -->1757988520720947[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

That guy &lbrace;npc.4208&rbrace;, no sense of professionalism at all... My good sake in the shop is disappearing at an alarming rate.
He's sneaking drinks from my stash! Asked him and he flat out denied it. If it weren't for our long friendship, there would be reprisals.]
Start -->1757989263913525[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Our Tengu doctrines explicitly state, &quot;Do not indulge in drink, do not indulge in pleasures.&quot; But how do you define indulging?
As long as you're not drunk, right?]
Start -->1758090784538209[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

&quot;All in&quot; is a do-or-die attitude! If you believe deep inside that this time you can turn it around, you can do it.
This is a gambling tip passed down from an elder in the Tengu tribe. Mind you, this elder is often penniless. So, it's not very reliable.]
Start -->1758091192677987[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Our Tengu clan has a unique skill. Just one look and we can see your fortune.
I see you're running low on luck today. Maybe don't wager too much, huh?]
Start -->1758185326111317[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

The mayor gave me the day off today, said even if the sky falls, she doesn't need my help. Guess I'm playing tourist then.]
Start -->1758248674655831[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Player:</b>

Enjoy it... little fox.]
Start -->1763028037140863[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

I didn't realize you knew me well enough to know my preferences.
According to clan rules, the Tengu clan never accepts bribes.
After all, it's a token of your appreciation, so I'll accept it with gratitude.]
Start -->1763028037141889[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

If you don't have anything to offer, you're either a traitor or a thief ......
Though your motives are obscure, this gift is very much to my liking.
I'll take it.]
Start -->1763028037142915[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

You shouldn't waste your energy on something so boring, should you?]
Start -->1763028037142917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

You really don't have much gift giving talent ......]
Start -->1763028037143943[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

You should know what happens when you tease the Tengu ......
You should run far away while my sword is still unsheathed.]
Start -->1763028037143945[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Birthday present? Thank you very much.
It's a very nice gift. I can see you're trying to get close to me.]
Start -->1763028037144971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Your birthday gift added another surprise to the day.
Thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;]
Start -->1763028037144973[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Although the gift was mediocre ......
But for the fact that you remembered my birthday
I'll take it well.]
Start -->1763028037145999[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Receiving this birthday gift was a real mixed bag of emotions.
Should I say thank you?]
Start -->1763028037146001[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Looks like you came here specifically to spoil the fun ......
But it's my birthday and I'm not going to turn this into a bloody accident.]
Start -->1763028037146003[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

See you later.]
Start -->1763028037147029[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

Goodbye ......]
Start -->1763028037147031[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Nyotengu:</b>

That's all for now ......]
