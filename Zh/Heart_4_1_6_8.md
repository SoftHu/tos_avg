The night of the earthquake… 
I knew you were the one I've been waiting for. 

I've seen you fight bravely and your mind is as sharp as your weapon.
You are meant to wield a Muramasa blade. 

And I was meant to forge for you. 
So here it is.

It only needs the Muramasa inscription that will imbue it with power. 
But the inscription is a potential curse. 
Drawing upon the wielder's life-force. 

But I've developed another way… 
I could have the blade draw upon the smith who made it. 
It could effect me instead– use my life-force.

I want you to know…
You are what I've been charging at my whole life. 
You're the swordsman worthy of this blade. 

I'm happy to have found you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;. 
And you do so much for our town.

I would gladly take the Muramasa curse for you and the protection of Seikyu.

Let's focus on our decision. 
Should I finish the Muramasa blade?
And which of us should face the inscription's side effects?
