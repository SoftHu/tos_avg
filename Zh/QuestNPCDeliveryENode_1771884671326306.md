Ho, thank you, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;,
This will help us put the final touches on my forge. 
This is where I will make a Muramasa blade one day. 

You must come visit when it's finished.
Actually, I wanted to ask your advice about the new shop.

Did you gather all the materials I need?]

I believe in your vision!
First, where would you put a shop entrance?

A busy street would bring in customers, eh?

 A quiet alley would feel exclusive and help me focus on work.

1771885191321722 -->1771885257513097[<b>Speaker 👉 赫菲:</b>

Makes sense. Next question!
I love making exquisite weaponry…
But ordinary people require more practical tools. 

Which should I focus on? ]

Hmm, lots to think about!
Now this last one I'm really wrestling with:

Should I write Muramasa's name on my sign or use my own? 
The Muramasa name is famous, but I'd also like to make a name for myself.

It's great to hear you say that! Time to build my own name!]

Thanks for your help. I really value your opinion, &lbrace;playername&rbrace;. 
You've got a good head on your shoulders.

The forge will be open any day now! 
And my weapons will help keep that head on your shoulders where it belongs!
