\n&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. Thank you for meeting me.
I couldn't sleep when I remembered I didn't cover requests in your tour.\nSo, this is a request board,
Locals post a request when they need help with something.
Special projects often require rare items found around Seikyu.\nAnd little bird chirps when there's a new request.
Cute isn't he?
We didn't teach him thatâ€”he just does it...\nCompleting requests will help develop Seikyu. 
I wish I could do them all myself... 
You'll be doing me a huge favor by helping out, and you'll get a reward.]

\nAlso, I hear you're looking for members of the Fox clanâ€¦
If people are happy with your work,
perhaps you can ask them for information about other foxes.\nLooks like there's already an outstanding request...
Seems like a good place to start. 
Have fun!]
