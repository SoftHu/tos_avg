\nHe is a tanuki, right?
Like what great-grand-whatever uncle said?]
1776858832992916 -->|Iâ€™m not sure.|1776858960251546[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>
\nHe seems nice! Andâ€¦ quirky!
An adventurerâ€¦ hmmâ€¦ that sounds like fun.]

1776858960251546 -->|Would you like to be an adventurer?|1776858992188070[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>

\nI feel close to mum and dad here.
Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re with us.
Maybe thatâ€™s why they left us the note to come here.]
1776859142912684 -->|Itâ€™s just a torn piece of paper.|1776859264572086[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>
\nWhen they disappeared, they took everything with them.
This piece of paper is a clue - 
just like a detective story!\nIâ€™m glad we finally decided to come to Seikyu.
Maybe weâ€™ll find the rest of the paperâ€¦
Maybe weâ€™ll find mum and dad.]
