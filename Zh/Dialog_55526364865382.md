\nAhhh, young ones! 
This is quite a sight.]

Is everyone gathering like this rare?]
1776844202961487 -->1776844225110608[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Koiwa:</b>
\nMmmm, Wise &lbrace;npc.4221&rbrace; last saw a gathering like this many years ago!
They came together for the two of you!]

\nAhhh, since the foxes vanished, Seikyu has been in turmoil!
They bought peace and orderâ€¦
It took a long time for our village to stabilize.]
1776844225110608 -->|I didnâ€™t realize we meant so much to them!|1776844265460311[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Koiwa:</b>
\nSeikyu has taken you under its wing, young ones.
This island has always been home to the foxesâ€¦
Everyone understands the significance of you two returning to your ancestral home.]

\nI didnâ€™t realize how important our ancestors were to Seikyu.]
1776844311462490 -->1776844352280157[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Koiwa:</b>
\nThey founded and protected us.
But with your entrance and &lbrace;npc.4209.full_name&rbrace;â€™s continued care and persistence, Seikyu is thriving once again!]
