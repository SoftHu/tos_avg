\nThat is the &lt;i&gt;Tales of Glory&lt;/i&gt;, it contains all of Inariâ€™s knowledge about humans.

She held the unwavering loyalty of the fox clan, 
as she led them to glorious heights.\nShe brought knowledge and progress to the foxes,
making use of their shapeshifting prowess.\nInari blessed the foxes with &lt;i&gt;The Tales of Glory&lt;/i&gt;.
A folio on the sophisticated culture of the human kind
