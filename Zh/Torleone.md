\nI should shove off! Farewell.]
Start -->1775525237421761[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMay the sea be still and the wind at your back.]
Start -->1775525237421765[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWhat a heart-warming expression of loyalty! You've won a powerful ally today, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. Thank you.]
Start -->1775525237421769[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nA generous offering. This would have won you a spot on my crew back in the day. Thank you. I'll not soon forget it.]
Start -->1775525237421773[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThis is a perfectly adequate tribute. Thank you.]
Start -->1775525237421777[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nHmm try harder next time. Or don't try at all.]
Start -->1775525237421781[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIn the old days I would have fought anyone who gave me such a ridiculous offering. Now I'll just say, 'No, thank you' and try to forget this insult.]
Start -->1775525237421785[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nHappy carp festival! I'm flying a flag for &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; today. Be sure to wish him well.]
Start -->1775525237421789[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe Carp festival actually has very little to do with fish. It's a shame really. Anyway, enjoy yourself.]
Start -->1775525237421793[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThe fish shop is only open in the mornings because we sell most our catch by midday. So make sure ya wake up early.]
Start -->1775525237421797[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI've joined Heph's fitness club to stay in peak physical condition. I want &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; to join but he's afraid he'll get squished. Poor kid.]
Start -->1775525237421801[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI take &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; and the boys fishing every weekend. It's good for morale and if our catch is bigger than &lbrace;npc.4203&rbrace;'s... well, all the better.]
Start -->1775525237421805[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nDamned crates! When I catch the rogue who stuck me with 'em, he'll think twice about crossing &lbrace;npc.4206&rbrace; again.]
Start -->1775525237421809[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nIs Heph lifting more than me? Can't have 'em thinking I've lost my edge. I'm no lazy old uncle, see!]
Start -->1775525237421813[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\n&lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace;, &lbrace;npc.4212&rbrace;, and &lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; are like my little crew. The Stormwave gang lives on! Perhaps you'd like to join one day?]
Start -->1775525237421817[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nTime and tide wait for no Yokai. If you want something... take it.]
Start -->1775525237421821[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWhen the sun sets, it's time for a drink.]
Start -->1775525237421825[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nRainy days are like doldrums at sea, the key is to keep your mind busy.]
Start -->1775525237421829[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThis is a gift worthy of 'the Godfather of the Sea'. Thank you, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421833[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThank you for the birthday tribute, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421837[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMy birthday was once celebrated by the whole Stormwave gang. Now I get mediocre gifts. Don't get old, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.]
Start -->1775525237421841[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI don't like this at all. Maybe the fish will find some use for it when I throw it into the sea.]
Start -->1775525237421845[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nMy heart swells with pride to receive such a birthday present. You've made aging far more bearable, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;. Please accept my deepest gratitude - old sea dog that I am!]
Start -->1775525237421849[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI should give &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; a surprise visit! That kid is the best.]

\nThe ocean is warmest in the autumn. Good for swiming but bad for storms. The sea is a mysterious woman I tell ya.]

\nThe cold makes me crave oysters. I've half a mind to open a kakigoya right here in Seikyu.]
Start -->1775525237421881[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI used to drink beer but now I'll take a glass of wine with a seafood dinner anyday.]

\nToday's gym day. And if a certain dress-maker sees me looking manly and swashbuckling... well, so be it.]
Start -->1775525237421913[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nI love getting out on the water and smelling the salty air!]
Start -->1775525237421917[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nThose crates still torment me. The black spot on the Stormwave gang's great legacy.]
Start -->1775525237421921[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nWorking out helps keep my mind off of &lt;i&gt;you know who&lt;/i&gt;. Thank you for helping me with my &lt;i&gt;situation&lt;/i&gt;.]

\nI thought Summer love was a young man's game but I'm reduced to a quivering schoolboy when I'm around her! Can you believe it?]

\nIt's sea urchin season. I could have some put aside for you if you like.]
Start -->1775525237421953[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\nAny news? I want to catch that scoundrel before they hole up for the cold season.]

\nThe sea is calm in the winter. Maybe I'll teach &lbrace;npc.4207&rbrace; to how to sail. Wouldn't that be something.]
Start -->1775525237421961[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Torleone:</b>
\n&lbrace;npc.4216&rbrace; talks of flying home for Winter. We need him to help stockpile fish but he misses his family. Being a leader means making tough decisions.]
