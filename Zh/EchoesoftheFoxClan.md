\nThis temple is dedicated to Inari.
Our goddess of transformation and harvest.
But everyone forgets the latter.\nThe fox clan are her chosen children
â€¦ or so the legends say.\nYour transformation abilities certainly suggest so.
And the fox holes in this temple too.\nIâ€™ve known scores of great foxes in my time.
But thenâ€¦ poofâ€¦]

\nWhere did they go?]
1774711928965451 -->1774711959005517[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nI havenâ€™t the foggiest!
Many think it was the tanukiâ€™s doing.]
1774711959005517 -->|Tanuki and Foxes donâ€™t get along.|1774711996014934[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nTanuki are tricksyâ€¦ practical jokers.
They really arenâ€™t so bad. 
But they always coveted the foxâ€™s powers.\nIn the end, both clans are quite similar, actually.]
1774711959005517 -->|We know about the Tanuki.|1774711996014934[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>

\nHmmâ€¦ So many questions in you. 
You know who might be able to help you?
The Goddess Inari!\nThe beautiful, 
the inimitable,
the omnipotent Goddess Inari!\nThere is an ancient book, &lt;i&gt;Tales of Glory&lt;/i&gt;.
It contains all of Inariâ€™s teachings. Yokai legends and Inari loreâ€¦
It also touches on fox clan history.\nYou might find cheap copies around.
Beware, those are just works of fiction.
The true version covers the 15 Inari Pillars.]

\nHow do we get this scroll?]
1775607129549195 -->1775607159457168[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nA page of the original is sealed in this altar.
There are rumors that &lbrace;npc.4202&rbrace; has another.
But no one knows where all the pages are hidden.\nIf I have all 15, I can make it whole again.
And Inari will once again bless us with her presence.\nAlas, we have only Inariâ€™s altar for now.
Inari only allows foxes through, though not just any fox.
You must make an offering, then sheâ€™ll decide if you are worthyâ€¦]
1775607159457168 -->|You just want a donation!|1774712178897260[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nI have no interest in your bobbles!
Iâ€™m a bestselling author and world-renowned adventurer!
I am &lt;i&gt;enlightened&lt;/i&gt;.\nAlso, I am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a fox.
Only a worthy fox can access it.]
1775607159457168 -->|Letâ€™s give it a shot.|1774712193587566[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Leon:</b>
\nGrand! Give her an offering,
And open yourself to her guidance.\nI will take my leave and give you some privacy.
Do visit again and freely explore the temple. 
It is yoursâ€¦ the fox clanâ€™s after all.\n&lt;i&gt;Foxes rediscovering their pastâ€¦
Taking their rightful place by Inariâ€™s sideâ€¦
Perfect for a new book. How exciting!&lt;/i&gt;]
1774712178897260 -->1775607202801046[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>
\nStop hassling the priest, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;.
Just make the offering. 
Perhaps we are worthy.]
