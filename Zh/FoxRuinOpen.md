\nThese are the fox ruins, a temple built by your clan long ago. 
This was once the center of fox life.
Itâ€™s fallen into disrepair since the foxesâ€™ disappearance.\nSome locals visit to collect rare plants and minerals,
and some things still live in its depthsâ€¦]

Oh, Iâ€™ll let you discover it on your own! 
Itâ€™s your homeland after all!\nPlease, let me open the door for you.]
