\nFarewell. If you need me simply speak my name.]
Start -->1730217216536675[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nI shall take my leave now, I'm sure you and Kon are busy!]
Start -->1730233993071725[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nFor me? Are you sure? The time you must have taken out of your already busy schedule to source this for me... how can I ever repay you?]
Start -->1730233993072751[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nHow did you know I liked this? Your attention to detail and care is far more than I deserve! Thank you!]
Start -->1730233993072753[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nYou two are far too kind!]
Start -->1730233993072755[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThis is a fine item, but I am not sure what use I would have for it!]
Start -->1730233993073781[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nMy time is limited here so I'll be blunt with you! I am not sure what made you think of me when you obtained this.]

接下来好好相处吧！]

\n晚上好……
其实我不太会喝酒呢
但是我又很想跟大家聊天\n姨妈会给我特别调制一些无酒精的饮料
什么干姜汽水啦，覆盆子果汁啦……
嘿嘿，主要是为了参与感。]
Start -->1757990030330425[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\n灯火酒绿，觥筹交错……
都市爱情故事往往都是这么发生的
你不觉得两个陌生的人就此相遇坠入爱河很浪漫吗？]
Start -->1757990760116796[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\n前几天，出于好奇，我试了姨妈新酿的酒
喝起来就像果汁一样甜美
但是当我恢复意识已经是第二天下午了。\n这是什么加速时间流逝的魔法道具吗？!]
Start -->1758097679938149[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\n青岚越来越热闹，按理说我应该开心才对
可是赌场建成到底算好事还是坏事呢？
我时常担心这一切会失控。]
Start -->1758100491311719[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\n漫漫长夜，总该找些消遣。
玩得愉快呀，&lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;]

\nAs much as I would like to stay here and admire the cherry blossoms, there is simply too much work to be done!]
Start -->1775163103296538[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThe weekend draws ever closer to to its end... is everyone ready for another bustling week in Seikyu?]
Start -->1775163107154971[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nWhere did the first half of the week go Miss Ama? There is still so much to do!]
Start -->1775164372485149[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nOh, well you know what they say - Work hard, Play hard. Right?]
Start -->1775164416326688[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nNow that warmer days are on the horizon I think it's time for the you-know-what Shuten!]
Start -->1775164420689953[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nI sometimes find myself staring into this fountain getting lost in my thoughts. Does that happen to you?]
Start -->1775164711722024[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nWhile the sun adornes the sky I am but a humble servent of Seikyu.]
Start -->1775164732277801[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nSeikyu is simply stunning at night... there is nothing that quite compares!]
Start -->1775164532912166[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThis weather puts a dampener on my productivity... how annoying!]
Start -->1775166031622193[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nA Birthday present, for me? How did you know? This, what a gift!]
Start -->1775166031623219[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nA gift from you makes my day a little bit brighter, thank you!]
Start -->1775166031624245[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nIt truly is kind of you to have remembered my Birthday, but a gift is far too generous.]
Start -->1775166031624247[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThis is a fine item, but I am not sure what use I would have for it!]
Start -->1775166031625275[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nI did not think you would remember given how busy you have been. You really know the way to my heart... this is perfect!]
Start -->1775166218007617[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nI'm sure you and Kon need to get back to the farm, I shall not keep you!]
Start -->1775166226185284[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nAs much as this line of inquiry fascinates me, my duty to Seikyu summons me away!]
Start -->1775166218007618[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nI have some free time later on and have baked some good that I would love to get your opinion on!  Pop by if you can!]
Start -->1775166486298698[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nDid you see the Koinobori I hung outside the farm? Kon mentioned you didn't have one so I stayed up last night making it!]
Start -->1775166486299724[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nEverything went according to plan, what a relief! Now how about we go and relax?]
Start -->1775166589369426[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThere is nothing I would rather be doing in this warm weather than helping out my townsfolk!]
Start -->1775166628730970[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nThese amber leaves signal the coming of colder months. I must make sure everything is prepared for winter!]
Start -->1775166633910364[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>

Start -->1775166820796512[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nIt has always saddened me that we could never restore the fox shrines to the way they once were. However, since you have come to Seikyu they've looked a lot better!]
Start -->1775172156249857[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
\nMay your first Christmas with us be a merry one &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace;!]

Start -->1775172173178628[<b>Speaker 👉 Oda:</b>
