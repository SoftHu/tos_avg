You must be the new resident of Seikyu.
I’m Musashi.
I run the general store in town. 
If you need anything, just let me know.
I’m sure you’ll want a few things for the old farmhouse. 
I can also buy anything you make here.
Just leave it in that consignment box over there and I’ll pick it up in the mornings. 
If you can find it, I can sell it. 
Can’t have you running out of money.
But you look like you know how to hustle some coins together…]

1768547359704213 -->1768547359706262[<b>Speaker 👉 武藏:</b>

Of course, I can see the family resemblance.
I wanted to be the first to lay eyes on our new neighbors. 
I should be getting back to the shop. 
Come find me if you ever want to go fishing.
See you soon,
