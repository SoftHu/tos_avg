\nHaha, impatient little fox!
I run the general store in town, let me know if you need anything.
Iâ€™ll also buy things you make or find.\nSee that box over there.
If you leave things there overnight, I will pick them up in the morning.
Iâ€™m what you might callâ€¦ entrepreneurial.\nBefore you sleep, just make sure all the things in there are for sale.
Iâ€™ll leave your money for you. Canâ€™t have you running out.
But you look like you know how to hustle some coins togetherâ€¦]
1775424467173733 -->|Our hustling days are over.|1768547359698063[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nI know the feeling.
I think we're going to get along, â€¦\nAnyway, Iâ€™ll leave you to settle down.
Iâ€™m glad to be one of the first to lay eyes on our new neighbours.\nCome find me if you ever want to go fishing.
Torleone will have a good rod if you need one.\nIâ€™m on the waters every Saturday with friends.
I find it relaxing.\nSee you soon, &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace; and Kon.]
