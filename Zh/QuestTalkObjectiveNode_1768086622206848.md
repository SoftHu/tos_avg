1775603892698780 -->1775603527389774[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Fujiki:</b>
\nI heard that there are yokai in the ruins,
and they can be aggressive.\nWith the place abandoned for the so long,
itâ€™s not surprising that others have moved in.\nIâ€™m sure &lbrace;c.playername&rbrace; you can handle yourself well, 
but probably not a suitable place for young Kon.]

You seem really clever and strong!\nPerhaps if we meet again, 
I will be able to tell you all about my trip there.
And if I end up meeting any unsavory characters!]
