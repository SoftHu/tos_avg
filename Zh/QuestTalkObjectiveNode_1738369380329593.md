\nWell, well. Nice to meet you too, stranger.\nThat's no way to treat a neighbor.]
1738369447807100 -->|Sorry, I thought you were a cat.|1738369514544259[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nThis place is full of surprises.
Things are rarely as they seem.]
1738369447807100 -->|Ohâ€¦|1738369637289097[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>
\nWhat, cat got your tongue?]

\nYou must be the new resident of Seikyu.
I'm Musashi.\nI run the general store in town. 
If you need anything, just let me know.\nI'm sure you'll want a few things for the old farmhouse. 
I can also buy anything you make here.\nJust leave it in that consignment box over there 
and I'll pick it up in the mornings. 
If you can find it, I can sell it. Can't have you running out of money.\nBut you look like you know how to hustle some coins togetherâ€¦]
1742696668586266 -->|Our hustling days are over.|1738369892088971[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Musashi:</b>

\nOf course, I can see the family resemblance.
I wanted to be the first to lay eyes on our new neighbors.\nI should be getting back to the shop. 
Come find me if you ever want to go fishing.\nSee you soon,
