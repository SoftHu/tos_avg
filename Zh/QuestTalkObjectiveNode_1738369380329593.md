You must be the new resident of Seikyu.
I'm Musashi.
I run the general store in town. 
If you need anything, just let me know.
I'm sure you'll want a few things for the old farmhouse. 
I can also buy anything you make here.
Just leave it in that consignment box over there 
and I'll pick it up in the mornings. 
If you can find it, I can sell it. Can't have you running out of money.
But you look like you know how to hustle some coins together…]

Of course, I can see the family resemblance.

Come find me if you ever want to go fishing.
See you soon,
