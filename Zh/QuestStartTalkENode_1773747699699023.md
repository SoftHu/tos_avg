\nMy fur feels all tingly!]

\nAh, youâ€™re perceptive, little one.\nThis was a great temple from our past.
Where Inari showed us the ways of shapeshifting.
Here, we learned, practiced, and grew strong!]
1773747798718818 -->1773747869768039[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nOh, how clever we were!]
1773747869768039 -->1773747882534249[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nTo explore the temple ruins nowâ€¦
Youâ€™ll have to make offerings, solve puzzles, and fight!]
1773747882534249 -->1773747897458027[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nBut itâ€™s worth the effort.]

\nThe ruins may help us find other foxes too.]
1773747994449274 -->1773748021377405[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ Kon:</b>
\nDoes it hold information about the foxesâ€™ disappearance?]
1773748021377405 -->1773748035614079[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nMaybeâ€¦ we donâ€™t know, my little ones.]
1773748035614079 -->1776927835955780[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>

But we always managed to keep them at bay.\nUntilâ€¦]
1773748102524300 -->1773748132730254[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nThe disappearances!
Iâ€™m telling you, we need to be on high alert.
I can feel the tanuki brewing something.]
1773748132730254 -->1773748148602256[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nTheyâ€™ve been distracted with their own territorial fights.
Until recently.]
1773748148602256 -->|What should we do?|1773748161052050[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>

1776928505934417 -->|No.|1776928635325019[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>

\nHa ha! He sounds harmless.]
1776928692663905 -->1773748070053257[<b>Speaker ğŸ‘‰ :</b>
\nWe were blind to their scheming ways.]
